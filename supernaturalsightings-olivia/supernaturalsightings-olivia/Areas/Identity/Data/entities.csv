Charleston Train Depot and Carriage Trail,Charleston,WV,On the bank of the Kanawaha River  at the train depot  just at the bottom of the exclusive South Hills mountain drive  the Charleston Train Depot rivals any 19th century European Town Center. At the depot  flanked by the river on one side and a winding suburban mountain road also exists a carriage trail which led  in days gone by  to the Governors Mansion. The depot has a restaurant and a scenic view. The old carriage trail is barely noticeable from the train platform  but driving up the hill on the right side of the forked road motorists can see a clear wide carriage road leading to what is now Sunrise Museum. Vagrants and homeless people are said to spend some nights near the bottom of the trail waiting for a train to hop  and high school students sometimes wander the trail at the top of the trail behind the museum. No one ventures past the desecrated statue of a Our Lady. A dark spot exists in summer and winter at the second curve from the top of the trail (or the third from the bottom). West Virginia was fiercely abolitionist during the Civil War and the state seceded from Virginia because the mountain men and their Indian Wives did not believe in slavery. The Underground Railroad ran through the exclusive South,Ghost
Capitol Plaza Theatre,Charleston,WV,"This theatre was built in 1909 on the site of the old Welch Mansion that had stood there since 1798. The theatre still houses some of the family that once lived in the mansion. Capital Plaza is now a venue for artists such as Tori Amos  R.E.M.  and other well-known musicians. The former theatre where ""Mountain Stage"" was recorded  is a place that gives people chills when they enter the area. The most prolific ghost here is that of John Welch. He was the son of the man who built the house and heir to the Welch fortune. John is very sneaky and likes to play around with peoples' minds. He is quite protective of the place and of the actors who frequent the stage. Another ghost  not quite as active  is known as Molly Welch. She was John's youngest daughter who died of pneumonia in 1840 around the age of eight. She is very shy  but sometimes when an actor is standing on stage  she can be seen sitting in the front row of the balcony.",Ghost

Report 11616: Fishermen find footprints east of Egegik.,Approximately 95 miles east of Egegik  Alaska. Up the Egegik River thirty-five miles  and sixty miles accross Becharoff Lake to the far south/east corner of the lake on the mouth of the Bear Creek spit.,AK,To whom it may concern  I am a commercial fisherman in Alaska and have been doing so since 1970. I am an avid outdoorsman  hunter and someone who just loves to get out there. Every year after fishing  I try to take a trip up river with a friend or two to wind down and enjoy ourselves before we go home. This year while I was on this trip into Alaska's interior our main mission was to take pictures of bears and the surrounding wildlife to promote a new bear viewing and sports fishing buisness. While on our five day trip  we spotted more than fourty bears. I took hundrends of pictures of these bears and their tracks. One of which  was so big  it put chills up my spin and gave me and my companions a very uneasy sense of insecurity. What set this track apart from the others was it's enormous size and human shape. In one of the pictures that I took of this track  I placed my foot next to it on the ground  keep in mind I am wearing a size 13 boot. Whatever made this track was so heavy  heavier than the biggest bear  that it pushed the gravel so far into the earth that it made us truly speculate what we were looking at. Other pictures that we took of bear tracks were nowhere close to the indentation that this track had left. One of the most intriguing things about this track was there were no visible claw marks as with all the other bear tacks. Both of us felt extremely uneasy of our surroundings and had the feeling that we were being watched. For the rest of the day we didn't have much to talk about  and that night felt uncomfortable at camp. We never heard or smelt anything out of the ordinary. To this day I'm not too sure what we saw and I'm not making any claims other than the words I have put fourth. I would like to include the photos I spoke of  as maybe you or someone on your staff might help me shed some light on this situation. I want nothing but to put my mind at ease. Wether this is a bear track from an extrememly enormous bear or...? Please help if you have any input.,Bigfoot
Report 25442: Hunter describes powerful wood knocks at a cabin in remote wilderness south of the town of Chicken,This is near Ketchumstock Mountain  about a 30 mile jaunt by ATV's to the west of the Taylor Highway south of Chicken Alaska.,AK,This is an excerpt from a short story I wrote about this hunting trip for mostly my family.  I am 64 years old and have 40+ years in law enforcement  currently serving as chief of police. With hunting season not to open until the day after next  we were in no hurry and enjoyed the evening with a touch of good single malt Irish talking about our past hunts and the one we were about to have.  Loyd and Davis would not arrive until the first day of the hunt  presumably because Dave had become domesticate sometime after the previous year’s hunt and had to attend a retirement party before being allowed to leave Valdez for camp. With the evening expended and the toll the day had taken on us we were in our sleeping bags and doubtlessly turning logs into sawdust by 2300 hours.  The stove was stoked with fresh firewood and all was good.  About 0215 I awoke feeling way too warm  unzipped my bag  slinging the top off  when I heard a resounding crack of wood striking wood  similar to a Louisville Slugger solidly striking a large  sound Birch tree very close to the cabin.  There being no one within many miles of us  my attention was immediately focused on the sound.  A few seconds later  the sound was repeated  which was to be the pattern for several minutes while I attempted to evaluate it to determine its source.  I finally decided to wake Bill saying in just above a whisper  “hey Bill”.  He stirred responding with something that sounded like “what” and did not move again for twenty minutes; when he woke up and asked what was going on.  In the mean time the commotion stopped when I initially attempted to awaken Bill up and I was sitting on the bunk with my .450 in hand waiting for whatever eventuality might arise.  Nearing 0300 hours I finally returned to a sound slumber awaking well into the following morning. With a spot of coffee in our gullets and having explained to Bill the events of the previous night we explored the area of the old village  inclusive of the nearby grave yard  in an effort to find an explanation.  We found numerous paths traversing the grassy area around the cabins with a multitude of bedding sites.  Never did we find anything that would provide us with an answer to the question of the source of sounds.  Explaining this to another friend after our return  with the experience of spending many years living in numerous villages  he asked me if there was a native graveyard nearby.  It is less than 50 yards from the cabin.  Nevertheless  I named the source “Sassy”.,Bigfoot
Report 7963: Sasquatch walks past window of house at night,At the edge of town.,AK,"This incident happened last night just after 11pm. My daughter was home alone. She lives with a relative  who was out of town. She called me at 11:22 pm; she was terrified. She said she could hear something walking back and forth by her bedroom window. She also said she looked out the window when she first heard it  and saw ""something"" big and black  really big. She described the ""thing"" to have been about 3-4 feet above the bottom of the window. When I went down to look behind the house this morning  I stood by the window. I am 5'4"" and my eyes just reach the bottom of the window  so I figure this ""thing"" must have been 7-8 feet tall. We live in a small village of less than 500 population.  There are a lot of bushes and trees in between the houses. Their house is close to the beach  and there is forest surrounding the town. Now  I've never known my daughter to afraid of anything  but last night when I went to pick her up  she was shaking like a leaf  she was hysterical  it took me almost an hour to calm her down. I questioned her about what happened. She called me about 5 minutes after she first saw it.  She was too scared to move. When I got down there  I would not look behind the house  but she was hiding in my relative's closet. She said it was walking back and forth right behind the house. She described the footsteps as a sound that someone very large walking on two feet  kind of like a ""stomping"". My daughter is very down-to-earth  not one prone to dramatics. When I first went down there  I didn't really know what was going on  just that my daughter was scared spitless  but I would not look behind the house.

We were trying to make it to the camp sites near the glachier but it started getting too dark even for us . So we decided to camp at the first available site . We found a small spot right off the trail so we made camp and hung our supplies in a tree down the trail   started a fire and were just finishing a small meal when I walked to the trail to smoke. I was standing on the trail a few minutes when I noticed what I thought was a man on a bike coming down the trail. I let my partner know  but when I looked back it was still in the same spot. I started looking more closely to see a face or the bike or something. It was then I realized it wasn't a person. It was a large dark form legs spread apart  this is what led me to think it was a person on a bike. The arms were curled at it's side like someone with hands on handle bars. Too big for a bear and the legs were too far apart. I called my partner but when turned back to look at it again it moved very quickly into the woods on two legs. The next day we looked but found no evidence of anything on the trail. I've told this story to a few people but they all think I'm crazy. I hope that this helps. I know what I saw  I guess I'm just hopeing somebody belives me....,Bigfoot
Report 9317: Driver on Alcan Highway has noon  road encounter near Alaska-Canada border,We were traveling westbound when the animal was sighted  standing at treeline on slight rise south of eastbound lane of highway.

I saw something from the waist up reaching to a higher part of a white bark tree. I did a double take and slammed on the brakes and came to a complete stop. Whatever it was had its back to us and still was reaching up with its right arm. The animal was a beautiful blond/auburn coloration and appeared well groomed as I could see the waist and well developed shoulders that blended into the head. I didn't see a real neck. I made a mental note using the tree as a height measuring device. I reached for the camera and my daughter but when we left our truck the animal was gone. We returned to our truck and continued driving until we pulled into the rest stop mentioned above.

Report 44986: Memory told of a close up daylight encounter with two  possibly young  Bigfoots near Abbeville,Specific instructions omitted for privacy reasons.,AL,"When my aunt was about 11 or 12 years old  she was helping her older cousin (Jerry) in the field at her aunt's house in an area called ""Screamer"" in Henry County  Alabama.  It was a hot day  and after some time Jerry grew very thirsty and asked my aunt to walk up the road to the house and get him a glass of water.  My aunt then walked through the field back toward the dirt road leading to her aunt's house.  Upon reaching the dirt road  she saw two creatures standing on the other side of the road.  She stopped and began slowly backing up  then stopped again.  She stood there looking at them  and they looking at her  for a minute or so  long enough for her to get a good look at them.  They were only around 10 feet away from her at that point - she on one side of the dirt road and they on the other.  She described them as standing next to each other.  One was  in her estimation  around 5 feet tall and the other was slightly shorter  around 4 feet tall.  She said that she got the impression that they were young.  She said that they were ""real hairy"" and completely covered in dark brownish black hair  that they looked sort of like gorillas but with human looking faces with hair on them  human looking hands  and human looking feet.  She said their noses were free of hair and that the color of their noses was dark brown or black  as were their feet and hands.  They stood very still other than blinking  just looking at her.  Except for being covered in thick hair  their faces looked human with regular human-looking noses.  After a minute or so  she took off running as fast as she could back up to the house to get the water Jerry had requested.  She did not look back as she ran.  She got the water  and proceeded to walk back toward the field.  The creatures were not there anymore.  She never told anyone about this incident until just a couple of months ago because she was always afraid people would make fun of her.",Bigfoot
Report 8679: Adult recalls childhood sighting at dusk near Moody,Around Moody  Alabama.,AL,"When I was around 11 years old  I had a strange encounter in the field behind my house.  At that time  I believed I saw a crazy old man  but I now realize that is all I could rationalize it to be. I was walking alone at dusk with my dog.  This was not unusual as I loved to be outside- my parents often had to force me inside by calling me in for the night.  Well  from what I can remember of that particular night  I was picking up rocks in a ditch and looking at them.  I might have been looking for a certain kind of rock but I can't remember exactly what I was doing.  It was definitely getting dark  but I could still see well enough to keep after the rocks for awhile longer.  I remember holding a stick I was using to pry rocks out of the dirt.  It was very quiet and still and there wasn't much wind.  As I was looking at the ground  I heard a noise in front of me and I looked up to see what it was  and that is when I saw him.  He stood right in front of me at a distance of 5 to 10 feet  he was tall  but hunched and quietly staring right at me.  He wasn't much taller than a normal man  but I got the impression he was old because he was hunching.  He looked like Rip Van Winkle to me  and that is what I thought of when I saw him.  He had a long shaggy beard around his facial area  but he was completely naked but for the long shaggy hair that was in matts all over his body.  I remember the hair was thin at his face  the base of his neck  and upper torso  but thicker around his beard  lower torso and legs.  All the hair was grayish white and very long and shaggy.  Mats of hair dangled from him in tatters.  His feet were bare.  His face was very humanlike  but not quite normal as it had very exaggerated wrinkles- again  a reason I thought he was a crazy old man.  His head seemed normal  but there was so much hair it was hard to make out his features except where the hair was thinner.  He appeared gaunt and thin  but in just a moment I would realize he was not like an old man at all.  I screamed as loud as I could out of fear and I noticed my dog bolted towards the house while I was taking in the sight of this strange thing in front of me.  The shaggy old man let out a scream of his own when I screamed.  He was staring right at me screaming in a voice that sounded like a woman shrieking- he seemed very scared of me as well.  I turned to run for my house.  I looked over my shoulder to see if he was following me and I saw him run up the ditch in the other direction.  He was extremely agile and fast- he was definitely not Rip Van Winkle.  He ran in a full sprint  very quickly for someone so hunched. I think I caught the dog running back to the house  as I was so frightened.  I remember running into the kitchen and telling my Mom there was a crazy old Rip Van Winkle in the field.  I remember describing how he was old looking  hunched  naked  and his hair was very long and matted like he hadn't cut it in 20 years.  I told her about how he had hair all over his body.  Needless to say  I wasn't believed.  I became obsessed with what I called ""the Shaggy old man"" or ""the Crazy old man"".  I believed that he must have been an old deformed hermit.  I kept a notebook in which I drew many sketches of him.  I remember keeping the notebook secret from my family  hiding it out of fear of being ridiculed.  I wish I had those sketches now but sadly I've misplaced that notebook.  I remember I went back to the spot in the field looking for him on other occasions  but I never ran into him again.  I wasn't aware enough to look for prints or anything like that  but I knew that he was out there somewhere and I wanted to prove he really existed to others. What changed my opinion of this sighting was a late night visit to a bigfoot website.  I was just browsing their sightings index and I came across several sightings in the same county I lived in and all described white or grayish colored creatures.  Honestly  I didn't realize bigfoot were sighted in this part of the country at that time  or even for most of my life  and just seeing all those other sightings was a revelation.  I realized for the first time that what I witnessed may not have been a crazy old shaggy man  but rather a bigfoot.  When I think back on the sighting  it all makes sense in that light.  There would be no reason for a naked old man to wander that field  much less to be covered in grayish  white  shaggy tattered hair.  The only reason I never thought of it as a bigfoot before was that I had never heard of an Alabama bigfoot  so the thought never entered my mind.  Also  I had never heard of a whitish gray colored bigfoot  and this creature was thinner than a typical bigfoot description- maybe he was older or maybe even younger.  He looked a bit hungry to me  as he was not some hulking powerful creature  but he was still strong looking and extremely agile.",Bigfoot

I was on one side of a hill. The road went down this hollow and back up the other side. In the ditch line was Bigfoot  about 8 ft. tall with arms that looked like they reached down past his knees. It was slightly leaned foward looking straight at me. It scared the daylights out of me. So I went back to my uncle's house and told him. He got his shot gun and we went back. It was still there looking at us. Uncle threw up the gun to shoot and I told him we needed to get closer. So we went down the hill and as we did we lost sight.

Report 7969: Youth hears vocalizations and is trailed while fishing on White River,I was only 13 at the time and didnt pay much attention to the roads.  The dirt road came down around a hill and leveled off along the east bank of the river.  The other side of the river was inaccessible due to a very steep bluff.  The bottom of the bluff was exposed rock with a slight outcropping from erosion.  About 50 feet up the bluff vegitation began with ever increasing pine trees and vegetation that continued at least another 200 plus yards to the top.  This part of the river was on a long gradual bend that obstructed lengthy views along the river in either direction.  I have fished the river many times as an adult but have yet to find the exact spot.,AR,When I was about 13 years old I went trout fishing with my mother and aunt on the White river in Arkansas.  We were staying at a motel in BullShoals.  One morning we drove to a remote area of the river to fish via an unkown dirt road.  We stopped to fish a bend of the river.  On the opposite side of the river(west)  was a tall stone bluff with a slight over crop from erosion.  On the east side was flatter land with 12 to 20 foot thin scrub trees about 20 to 30 feet from the water  as the river was low.  While my mother and aunt where fishing off the bank  I decided to try my luck further up river  about 300 yards away and just out of sight with my mother.  While I was fishing along the bank I began to hear rustling sounds in the trees and shrubs behind me.  I looked in the direction of the noise and could see the tops of the these thin trees moving as if something were walking through them and pushing them to the side  but due to the thickness of the vegetation I could not see what was actually moving the trees.  I stood and observed this activity for 2 or 3 minutes.  I began hearing grunting type sounds that were very deep and substantial sounding.  These sounds were similar but different than grunt sounds a bull would make.  The movement of the trees began to appear as if something were shaking the trees at this point instead of moving through them.  It appeared that whatever was making the noises was only about 10 feet inside the brush yet I could not see what it was.  Feeling nervous  I decided I should return to my mothers side and began walking back towards my mother.  As I did  whatever was in the brush moved with me step for step.  As I walked the movement in the trees seemed more forceful with the sounds of large branches breaking as it moved.  When I got within sight of my mother (about 50 yards)  all activity stopped.  I informed my mother there was something in the brush following me  but she shrugged it off.  Within a few minutes we decided to leave as we werent catching any fish.,Bigfoot
Report 7045: Man riding 4-wheeler observes a bigfoot reaching into a tree,,AR,Well i live in bentonville Akansas right now  my dad own his own buisness. One Day we got on the subject i was telling him that i had bought a little book of ghost stories and bigfoot sightings and how i was very  itrested in bigfoot. Then he told me that he seen bigfoot before and he told me the whole story. At fist i didnt belive him  but a couple of years later he told me the same story when we got on the topic again. The story is that he was riding ATVs with his friends around or in ether lost bridge lake of bever lake and he was at the front of the group of 4-wheelers and they were going down this hill that led to a dirt road. Since he was in front of the group he went down first and got on the dirt road and stopped to wait for the rest of the group to come down. before they came down he lokked over across the dirt road on the other side of the hill on the tree line where the evevning sun was shining through the trees and seen the big foot walking. He said it was taking really big steps and apered to be 7-8 feet tall. He couldnt se the color because the sun was shining through the trees and big foot so you know it apeared as a shadow. Then the rest of the group came down and he told them what he saw and they didnt belive him. Thats all he told me. He told me he coudnt remeber every detale. But he still knows more than me  i cant remeber everything. The reason i'm telling you and not him is that i probably coudn't get him to get on here to tell you this. I'm telling you this because im learnig about bigfoot in our biology class at bentonville high school. my teacher is a marine biologist and a cytozoologist. We watched the big foot movie and the legend of boggy creek in class. Plus the sightings in Decator which is write by our town. So all this bigfoot stuff is making me so excited to dicover the bigfoot and do my part in adding another unreported sighting  since i know theres got to be alot of them out there. If you need any more info i dont have a phone but you can write me at (Withheld)  my name is (withheld) or you can call my dad who was the one who seen it at (withheld),Bigfoot
Report 12824: Two sets of tracks found near Lake DeGray.,This area is in the Arlie Moore area of the corp land surrounding Lake DeGray.,AR,Wednesday  October  12  2005 our neighbors dogs were very active and barking all night.  The next morning about 5:30am my own dog was barking in the backyard.  I opened the door to calm her down and I heard something in the back of our property near the fruit trees.  It was very heavy sounding and I could hear branches breaking as it departed.  The next morning around 8:30am my husband went to his truck in the backyard and heard something behind our shop take off running.  He thought it was a hunter and ran to the back to listen.  He thought it sounded like it was on two feet.  He said it stomped very heavily as it was running through the woods and he could hear snorting.  Sunday  October 16th  I went walking around the neighborhood road and discovered several sets of large and small barefootprints on the gray slate road in front of our house.  At first I thought it was a childs footprint until I looked closer.  There were two sets.  The largest measured 13.5 by 7 inches and the small print measured 9 by 4 inches. I took pictures of all the prints and measured each print.  They consistenly measured the same size.  The large print is about 3 inches wider than my husbands foot and he's a big man.,Bigfoot

As we drove up snow bowl rd to reach the Arizona Snowbowl  we saw a large tall figure walking in long strides through the trees. I would say about 40 yards from the desolate road. As an avid ""Finding Bigfoot"" watcher  our sighting was everything we heard/saw on the show. The squatch had to have been at least 8 or 9 feet tall. It was too far away to make out any features  but the way it walked  the posture  and dark brown/black color it was unmistakeable. Definitely not a bear or deer. We saw the creature take two long strides through the trees and ""disappear"". A feeling came over us of shock/fear/amazement. I had goosebumps all over my body.",Bigfoot

At 4:15am  my girlfriend and I were up sitting inside the tent feeding my little boy when we heard a loud low sounding roar coming near the west side campground. Immediately  some of the campers' dogs started to bark like crazy. I asked my girlfriend ""did you hear that?""  she replied ""yes  what is it? It sounds scary"". I told her that its something huge with a good set of lungs. We heard it about 5-6 times. Duration of the calls would last like 10 seconds long. About 5 minutes later  the call ceased. But we could still hear the dogs barking away. Then at 4:45am  we heard one more call from the same location. Afterwards  my girlfriend and my little boy went back to sleep while I stayed awake all morning. The next morning  I asked my cousins if they heard the calls and they said they didn't.",Bigfoot
Report 63645: Mattole River Watershed (Lost Coast region) resident reporting loud knocks and vocalizations.,In a remote location near Baker Creek road.,CA,"You would be interested in what happened to me a year ago  and twice more in 24 hours  just 2 weeks ago  near the Humboldt Mendo County headwaters of the Matole River. I am absolutely convinced that some unknown animal exists here so I began on the internet a search for similar accounts.  While immersed in the Internet searching it became clear to me that your organization should have this most recent information in a timely manner. Last July 2018  I was staying in a very isolated region  which had very limited access  behind 3 locked gates and 20 miles south of Whitethorn  CA  on a primitive 4x4 road.  This place is at the end of the world  on the northern border of a vast green belt spreading from Shelter Cove on the coast  east to Highway 101   and south to Fort Bragg  and east to Piercy  as can be seen on Google Earth. About 3 a.m. I was awake  it was a hot and dark night in these mountains.  Something above my tent location  approximately 200-300 meters  began knocking on wood  best described as loud whacks on a tree trunk by a big club or branch.  It started with one knock  which got my attention  with a brief hesitation  then several more knocks  but randomly timed  some in succession  others after hesitations.  The knocking was loud  so loud that it echoed down the canyon. The event lasted only a minute or two. My first thoughts were that there was no one on the mountain who could be out here in the middle of a primitive and protected area.  These knocks were obviously from something large  and no North American animal could have made them.  I listened intently while my mind tried to wrap around how the noise was made.  The woods were silent  not even a cricket.  I told a few locals afterward and learned that there were other hotspots for squatch sightings between Piercy and up to Willow Creek. Flash forward to two weeks ago  when waiting at the first locked gate to this same conservation area  I heard two distinct vocalizations which cannot be explained. As I waited in the dusk for about 45 minutes  waiting to meet a party at the gate who were running late  I heard a very loud wail/ scream/ call that I've never heard before in nature.  The call of this thing I located at about my 2 o'clock  facing east  and up the heavily wooded area above me  about 200-300 meters.  I instantly knew where I had heard such an unfamiliar call....about 3 years ago when watching a Bigfoot reality show  where these squatch hunters were making this strange/unique call while searching for Bigfoot. There was a few second delay from the first call  then a few more  then silence for about a minute  leaving me to wonder if this whole experience was real  pondering what I know about the wilderness  either that was an unknown animal or some kind of implausible prank.  It was loud  echoing down the mountain  as though some huge creature could belt like the lungs of Pavarotti  only much louder!  The chance of it being a prankster waiting in silence with me for 45 minutes in that remote location  just to hang out in these impenetrable woods and prank me  went away very quickly when  when another call out at about 3-400 meters to the north of the first  approx my 8 o'clock.  It was also just as loud  just as unique as the first  but came only 3 calls in succession  u-ah-o  u-ah-o  u-ah-o  with a distinct higher pitch on the ""ah"".  This absolutely blew my mind  because the first call might be an elk on steroids  but the response from what was clearly not an owl  brought chills down my spine.  This was some kind of communication between two individuals  neither which can be explained by any rationale. I must tell you that I have trekked and lived in remote areas in Africa  Australia  central and south America  many places of potential danger  and never had an inkling of fear.  I was born and raised near Yellowstone Park  with 100 times the average distance trekked by most individuals in their lifetime  and never had bad experiences with grizzly  mountain lions and wolves.  Travelling all these years with a firm understanding of ecosystems  I never could have believed in such mysteries  that anything new would ever be discovered. I had a fourth experience  which I must say something about  but it happened just the night before the dual vocalizations. On Friday evening  Nov 1st  2019  I had just moved into a cabin that my brother and I rented  located along an extremely rugged canyon area of the Matole River.  It was dusk  quite dark already in the forest.  I was outside looking at the stars  taking in the newness of these rugged surroundings.  Up above  again about 300 meters up and to the east of the river  there was a screaming that was so loud and so foreboding that I could only listen in amazement.  It was the loudest screaming I've ever heard  so loud I thought it was produced by some kind of banshees from a horror film. The screams continued  full throttle  for over 5 minutes.  I know mountain lions can scream  but nothing like this. It sounded much louder  more guttural  literally as if someone had set up a loud speaker and played the bloodiest scream that Hollywood could produce.  At the time  the night after Halloween  I wondered if someone was up on the mountainside pranking me as a newcomer to the neighborhood. I listened for a bit  then went inside and told my brother about it because it was so unnerving.  Bigfoot did not even enter my mind.  But then at dusk the next evening I witnessed these 2 calls waiting at the gate. I have since been over and over in my mind  why have I been so lucky as to hear or experience such mystery?  Much less 3 distinct vocalizations which cannot be explained.  I began pouring over USGS maps and satellite imagery to ascertain what the link may be  20 miles apart  are there any people or neighbors or access for individuals in the areas I experienced which may explain these?  Could one individual in such obvious stress on one night  have triggered the coincidental travel of at least 2 more unknown creatures the very next night?? I have talked to many locals about hearing strange noises  but no one claims anything  or they don't want to be ridiculed. Look  I am a man  60 yo  with extensive wilderness experience in forests and jungles all over the world.  The closest thing to new species discovery for me was the Costa Rican jungles  but my mind has always been as a skeptic observer  dealing in evidence based biology as a science.  What has happened to me recently has completely changed me!  There is a mystery in these woods  and I have a few ideas how to answer them. Please feel free to contact me  if you would like access to these remote locations.  And I am very curious if other people in my area are having similar experiences.  Something unexplained to science lives out here  and I am beside myself with these recent events. Troy Hunter   troy.hntr@gmail.com.  There is very limited cell service.  928-231-3***.",Bigfoot
Report 2311: Two hikers have interesting experience near Strawberry,,CA,While walking on a road headed toward Bert Reed's historic cabin on the Stanislaus National Forest  the forest suddenly went silent  and then something in the brush screamed at me and the person I was with.  We were unable to see what had made the sound.  We felt like something was watching us  and we both had a terrible fear (but we had both come across bears and other animals in the forest  and never felt this type of fear before).  The fear made us unable to move or speak. After several minutes  the regular forest noises started again  and since we felt better (like we weren't going to die)  we were able to move away from the location.  We continued on to where we were headed  and on the way back  we went by the same location  but nothing was there.,Bigfoot
Report 7336: Runner Hears Unusual Whistle Near Woodsford,Hwy 88 to Blue Lakes Rd.   I think.  Its been 17 years since I've been there.,CA,While walking cross-country  looking for possible home sites from the early 19th and late 18 hundreds  I was walking the base of a small ridge between two lakes Lower Blue and Twin Lake. On the ridge side it was mostly open forest on the Twin Lake side the brush got thicker. As I was walking I heard a loud two tone whistle [low to high pitch] that was not a bird or any animal I know. The sound came from ground level and behind me to my left. The whistle was loud and sounded in my opinion from a mammal. I turned and called out thinking a hunter [in a place he should not have been][no hunting zone] but no one answered  I whistled back but nothing called. Wondering what it was  I investigated the area 'till i could get no farther  the brush was too thick. I was standing within 10 feet from where the whistle came from  nothing in sight not in the trees on the ground not anywhere  no bird's where flying and no animals in sight either. It was a little spooky but at the time i was cross-country running almost 5 miles a day at 8000 feet as well as boxing training and being a good bow hunter nothing scared me at that time. I was 20 with a good outdoor understanding and other people were the only things that scared me. I remember after I got back to the cabin and asked my Dad what animal out there [if he knew] that whistled like us but much louder  he didn’t know of any. I did not think anything about bigfoot even though I was interested in the subject  I thought they were all up north in the Shasta and up area. I did not know that BF made whistling sounds until I went through the BFRO website.,Bigfoot

I looked in the direction they were barking and standing in a suger beet field thirty to forty feet away was a humanoid figure covered in long shaggy grey hair.  This thing was massive and I would imagine it was at least eight feet tall.  It didn't move - it just stood there looking at us.  Needless to say in 1962 I didn't know what bigfoot was so I turned my bike around and got the hell out there. My dogs a collie and an Australian shepherd beat me home.,Bigfoot

We packed up and drove southbound as we approached an area of Hwy 101 were the Eel River makes a large bend towards the highway I saw movement down by the river.  My vantage point was above the animal I saw and I was driving slowly.  What I saw was a human like ""creature"" walking slowly away from the river across a rocky sandbar towards the forest.  The color appeared to be a reddish brown.  The creature walked with the same apparent gait as the creature seen in the Patterson film.  It wasn't a bear  bears don't walk with an apparent human type gait.  I talked to my wife after driving several miles down the road and prior to me asking her if she had seen anything unusal she said yes.  Later on my daughter who was sitting in the back also said that she saw the same creature.  I am a law enforcement officer and know that I saw ""Bigfoot"" - there is no doubt about it.",Bigfoot

Witness  who will be called Jeff  said he and his friend were alone at his parents house one night when the friend  since deceased   noticed ""something"" looking into the house through the front door. Since the friend was ""always a kidder "" Jeff just looked outside to call his friend's bluff. ""But sure enough  there was this head looking at us.'' He said since it was dark  few details were visible  but he described it as ""like a coconut.'' ""We freaked out  so we ran into mom's bedroom and grabbed the .22 and loaded it with bullets. I told (the friend) to go lock the door  but he said no way. So we ran into the bedroom  which at the time didn't have curtains. Soon we heard it breathing and kind of scratching at the window and we saw a hand up against the screen. I would say it had to be 8 to 10 feet tall to be looking in like that.'' Witness stated at that time  he could see the animal looking in the window. He described it as ""large  hairy and black.'' ""My friend fired two shots at it  but missed. It took off running and we didn't see it after that.'' The two called the sheriff  who came to investigate and found the two bullet holes in the window  but no blood and no footprints on the hard adobe ground. The sheriff asked if the two had been drinking  but both were aspiring wrestlers. Jeff said neither of them drank nor used drugs. Jeff's brother  who initially contacted the BFRO  said that when he and his parents came home  his brother and friend appeared to be ""scared to death.''

Report 17767: Night-time sighting by Marine training near Ft Carson,Cheyenne Mountain  near NORAD.,CO,While training at Ft Carson  I was on patrol with a Marine Recon Agressor Force  agressing fire batteries in simulated attacks.  My patrol attacked the HQ company  and during the withdrawal  I was separated from my unit.  There was plenty of ambient light  and I could see my unit across the field and hear them calling for me.  They took off  and I figured I could cut through a wooded area and intercept them.  As I rounded a bend in the trail  a figure stepped out into the trail in front me.  It was about 6.5 feet tall  covered in light brown fur  had large fox-like ears  and large  black  globe-shaped eyes.  The nostrils were slitted and large  without much nasal definition.  The body was muscular  with a thin waist and easily discernible definition  and the arms were long  hanging below the level of the hips.  The creature stepped out into the trail  looking in the opposite direction  and I had stopped stock-still the moment I saw it.  It turned and saw me  at which it exhibited a startle reflex then immediately crouched down and slowly moved sideways off the trail  watching me the entire time.  It knelt behind a bush  at which point it became very hard to see. I realized that I was encountering something few people have the opportunity to see  at only a distance of about 10 feet.,Bigfoot

There is no doubt in my mind that what I was hearing was a vocalization of some sort. I have spent my entire life in Colorado  and spent quite a bit of time in the outdoors  and this sound was unlike anything I have ever heard  and I can not imagine any animal in Colorado that would be capable of making this sound. It started as a very low range roar  of sorts  and built in volume and range to a high pitched  very primal scream. The sound was very  very loud  and very ""large""  for lack of a better word. The sound came from an area closed to vehicles  and it echoed from the surrounding hills. The duration was about 6-7 seconds  and it was repeated 4 times in the course of about 90 seconds. This sound was so primal  so intense  so big  that it raised the hair on my arms and the back of my neck  and I was chilled as I have never been before in the wilderness. I know what bear  elk  raptors  and big cats sound like in Colorado  and I assure you  this was nothing like I have ever even imagined.",Bigfoot

Report 407: Possible vocalizations heard while motorists were taking a break at turnout near La Manga Pass,Highway 17...Rio Grande National Forest...midway up the grade rising from a small bridge over the Conejos River to La Manga Pass.,CO,"We were on Highway 17 in southern Colorado  heading south through the Rio Grande National Forest toward Chama  NM. As we neared the border  Highway 17 began snaking up a five mile grade beginning at the Conejos River and cresting at La Manga Pass (10 230ft). Midway up the grade  we pulled off at a turnout to take a break and survey the surrounding forests  enjoying the view the elevation afforded us. The morning was quite brisk and one of the individuals in our party let out a ""whoop"" as we exited our vehicles. Soon after the echoes of the ""whoop"" had faded into the distance  we heard what sounded like a very loud roar (made by some type of nearby ""animal"")  unlike anything I'd ever heard before  that lasted for several seconds. Following a short pause there was another roar  then a pause  and then a final roar. The ""roar"" can best be described as being almost exactly that (sound  duration  pausing) which is currently found on this website  listed as a potential Bigfoot ""howl"" recorded in Ohio. In fact  listening to the ""howl"" and noting the distinct similarities to the ""roar""  is what prompted me to submit this report. In the silence following the final roar  I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand on end and uttered the only thing that came to mind at that point. Namely  ""What the hell was that?"" And  needless to say  I apparently wasn't alone in my thoughts as  with minimal discussion  our group quickly departed. In retrospect  even though we were seemingly alone on the grade  someone could have been playing tricks on us. Whatever  whether it was someone or something  the ""whoop"" issued by a person in our party is seemingly what precipitated the sounds we heard.",Bigfoot

Report 16408: Children observe bipedal animal walking along railroad tracks near the Housatonic River,"Proceding north on Howe Ave. in Shelton  CT take a left at Indian Wells State Park. The road turns into a windy  one lane road above the park  with blind curves and ""pullovers"" because only one car can pass at a time. At about 2 miles  the road crosses over a railroad track and continues to the cottage area. It was about 100 yards above the crossing that this event took place.",CT,This took place 53 years ago  however  I have lived with the vision of this creature all my life and have told no one about it. I was visiting a relative's cottage on Housatonic Lake near Indian Wells State Park in the White Hills region of Shelton  CT. Back then (1953) this area was not inhabited very densely and still is not today. There were 3 of us  all age 5-6  and we left the cottage and headed for the railroad track  which ran along the Housatonic River and Lake  to pick wild blackberries to put on our cereal. It was about 1/3 mile from the cottage. As we were busy picking  a large (6 1/2' to 7' tall) creature came down the steep hillside and proceeded to walk northward along the railroad tracks  staring at the 3 of us once  and moving at a fast walk. I remember the length of it's stride (about 5') and it's arms which looked like they went almost to it's knees. The body was covered in a dark brown/grayish color hair and it had the face of a primate. The hair was shorter than Bigfoots I've seen on TV (Patterson film) and it's body was thinner than those also. We ran back to the cottage to tell our parents who dismissed this as children's fantasy. This event took place BEFORE there was ever a mention of anything like Bigfoot  especially in this area.,Bigfoot

As we passed him I jumped out of my seat and turned around and kept my eyes locked on him as long as I could. My boyfriend asked me why I did that and I told him  “I think just saw a Sasquatch. I just saw the weirdest thing and it was not a human.” And went on to describe what I saw.,Bigfoot
Report 55169: Couple hear possible knocks while fishing one morning near Lyme,,CT,"On July 3rd  2016  at around 7AM I was fishing at Norwich Pond in Lyme  CT.  I caught my first fish within minutes of arriving.  When I brought the fish to shore I heard 3 distinct knocks coming from behind and above me. There is a rather steep  high (30 ft?) slope along the access road near the boat ramp. I turned around thinking it was people walking down the road.  Nothing there...  I threw the fish back and recast.  I caught another within a few minutes.  As i brought this one to shore  I heard another 3 distinct knocks from the same spot and again turned around to see if someone was there.  No one! This boat launch/pond is about 4 - 5 miles in from the main road and the only houses around were on the other side of the pond  the opposite direction of the knocks.  I am pretty sure it was an encounter with Sasquatch even though I did not see or smell one.  The knocking was too ""human"" to be an animal and there were NO people around.",Bigfoot
Report 28720: Traveler observes a tall biped in a cornfield north of Bethany Beach,,DE,"Our family was driving home from vacation last August when I saw something unusual in a cornfield. We were roughly 40-45 minutes north of Bethany Beach  Delaware traveling on Route 1 passing through farm country at the time.  We had rented a minivan and my husband was seated upfront driving with his Father next to him in the passenger's seat. They were busy talking.  My daughter and mother-in-law were seated in the row of seats behind them.  My mother-in-law was reading a book to my daughter at the time.  I was seated in the very last row of seats in the minivan and sat on the passenger's side of the car. As we were driving along and everyone else was busy either talking or reading  I was looking out the window at the passing countryside.  We were going through farm country at the time and as we drove past one corn field  something caught my eye.  The thing that initially got my attention was the fact that the corn stalks were now dried and yellow and it appeared that something dark brown was standing there in the middle of the corn stalks.  The roadway was slightly elevated above this particular field so I was essentially looking down onto the tops of cornstalks rather than them being level with the van. Having an interest in the subject of Bigfoot  I immediately went into observation mode and noted the following:  What I saw was medium to dark brown in color  it was taller than the cornstalks  it appeared to be about 3 feet wide and I may have been looking at a head and shoulders and it definitely wasn't a piece of farm equipment  a scarecrow or a human.  In fact  I noted that there were no humans around on the farm at the time.  I was able to observe this for roughly 5-10 seconds as our minivan drove past this large field.  The brown ""thing"" was roughly 300 feet in off the road in the cornfield by itself. I quickly tried to note the general location of where we were at the time.  I do not live in Delaware and was not familiar with the precise location.  However  not long after that  I spotted a sign for the Milton  Delaware exit off of Route 1.",Bigfoot

She went back into the house and while I stood there I could here the trees moving around  I have been watching the show and joking with the kids and wife with calling them in the rear of our wooded lot but after hearing this I can honestly say they are out there. This couldn't have been 100ft away from me and was so loud that it felt like it was next to me  I don't know if it was the light music playing that had it let me hear it or the practice calling in the rear yard but there are definitly BIG FOOTS IN DELAWARE,Bigfoot
Report 39121: Recollection of a possible night time road crossing near Angola,On route 24 near Angola area,DE,In 1998 or 1999 my brother and a friend were meeting up with me and another friend at home. When they came in the house they were both filled with fear with what that had just saw. It was winter time and it was also in the evening around 7 p.m. and raining. They were driving down route 24 near the Angola light when something ran across the road on all fours. Then when it got across the road to the field they both said it stood up and it had red eyes. I just started to watch the television show finding bigfoot and remembered that night and called my brother up again to get the details to see if I remembered it right.,Bigfoot
Report 33088: Couple find large footprint on Lake Cosby,,FL,You have had an encounter with my family  the Bridges over in Quincy  Florida. I now live in jacksonville  Fl. with my boyfriend  his mothers friend has a lake house in Lake Crosby. We took a day trip out there and as we were walking from the end of the dock up to the lake house. It intriged us greatly when we looked to the left and saw a foot print that was not a normal size. We jumped off the dock to get a closer look  it was exactly how a big foot print looks. It was about 11-12 inches long and 5 inches wide. While we were there  there was ducks in the water near shore. The area is very swampy like a marsh  and deserted from a lot of human commotion. Furthermore  my knowledge provokes me to go back to where it was sighted and do further research ourselves. We do believe the area is habitat to big foot. To have your opinion about the situation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.,Bigfoot
Report 28450: Possible footprint found and vocalizations heard in the Flying Eagle Wildlife Management Area,Located in Flying Eagle WMA about 5 miles East of downtown Inverness.,FL,Yesterday  on October 31st  2010  I was hunting in Flying Eagle WMA with a friend when I discovered something that I thought was very unusual. It was around 10:20 in the morning when we decided to meet back up and do some scouting for our last afternoon hunt on my quota. I had set my friend up a few hundred yards or so from Hwy 44 in the morning before daylight and I continued on for about 3/4-1 mi. on the edge of the swamp we were hunting. As I continued on I jumped something that ran off and sounded unlike a deer or hog but didn't think anything of it. We were sitting on ground. After we met up we started walking back towards the truck and saw a couple of wet areas (puddles) when I said to my friend  let me check and see if there are any prints leading to the water to get a drink. As I walked over there to see I looked down and noticed something out of the ordinary. I called my friend over to show him. It was a footprint  similar to a humans. Not real large but kind of wide for the length of it. It was so fresh that you could still see the thermal lines in the mud from the bottom of the foot. It was the only one that we could really make out. The heal and ball made deep impressions while the toes were not really deep in the mud in comparison. I had my cell phone with me so I took two photos of the print and one of the area we were in then he marked a tree next to it so we could find it again. It just seemed very odd to find a print like that in the middle of a swamp! We returned after lunch for an afternoon hunt. I did notice one other thing with the squirrels after we returned. I didn't go as far this time  but I noticed the squirrels barking more than usual off in the distance. It is how they warn others of pending danger. As time went on they got closer and closer to where I was sitting and then all of a sudden went silent. Just an observation! I have spent most of my life in the woods in florida either hiking  biking or hunting this was the first time I noticed something like this. It is probably human but who would be out there barefoot?? We ended up laughing quite hard about it after we named him Eddie the Yeti and I will ad this is not the first time I have heard or smelt something out of the ordinary while in the woods.,Bigfoot

Road #1 runs parallel with the Florida Turnpike and is approximately 1.25 miles east of the Turnpike at the point of sighting.,FL,Witness and a friend were deer hunting that day. They were resting by their vehicles at approximately 1:30 pm when the witness looked north on the road (Rd. #1) and observed 2 Bigfoot crossing the road from west to east. The Bigfoot crossed from an oak hammack into an area of pines and tall palmettos. Approximately  225 yards east through the pines is a large swamp. The witness and his friend were roughly 2/10  of a mile away from the creatures when they crossed the road. The witness saw a large male  6.5 ft. tall with light brown hair cross the road first. When the witness first saw the male he thought it was another hunter walking around without an orange safety vest on. The witness states that it was walking weird and slightly hunched over. When the second one came into view (5.5 ft. tall) it was completely black and had breasts. She also appeared to be carrying something about her waist with both hands. The witness feels she was either very pregnant or carrying a young Bigfoot. The male was 15 yards in front of the female. The witness states that the female had hairy breasts and that both bigfoot walked without locking their knees.,Bigfoot
Report 18361: A group of four-wheelers experience a barrage of rocks and limbs on a late-night ride near Meldrim,On the only railroad track from Bloomingdale -Meldrim   This occurred between the two,GA,While riding 4wheelers my wife and I and another couple decided to follow the railroad tracks to the next town. It was about a ten mile treck that goes through swamp and none of which is developed. I have never followed it before at night. At about halfway to the other town (Meldrim Ga.) it looked as though the light at the far end of the tracks was getting brighter.We pulled off the side and backed up to the ditch that parallels the railroad bed to wait to see if the light got brighter.While waiting my wife and friends sat and talked and I climbed back onto the tracks on foot to watch the light. The plan was to wait ten minutes and if it didn't get brighter it was possibly a light from another source. After about five minutes my wife and her friend heard something moving progressively closer in the woods. Then large objects began falling around us. I looked at everyone asked had they heard it   then there was no doubt. Larger objects started coming down -large rocks  large limbs. Many were landing in the water  not all in the same place   not all the same size  making huge splashes like bricks would make or larger. One then two then multiple large things landing on both sides and on top of the tracks. Everyone with me by then was right beside me and none of them were playing a joke. Something was throwing stuff at us from the woods. I kept shining my flashlight but never saw what. These were big objects and there is no way any animal I am familliar with could have done this. I have hunted all my life and stay in the woods all the time but this truly freaked me out. As a side note when I used to stay with a friend at his house near the tracks on the Bloomingdale end his grandad used to tell us of howls that came from the woods down the swamp that he couldnt explain. He said they would sound like screaming I've always been skeptical of that but now I am not so sure.,Bigfoot

That is the only reason I am not giving the location of where all this is occurring. I am a registered nurse. I care about my job and reputation but I would rather have a ""rep of being crazy"" than ever having any harm done to this creature.

We came out of the lead at about 3:00AM and started gathering our caving gear together for the 1/2 mile walk to the car. As we are about to leave the strangest call I have ever heard came from the opposite side of the sink from us. Distance would have been about 900'. The three of us have been woodsmen all our lives but none of us had ever heard a call like that. It sounded like four different animals in one. All powered by what must have been an enormous set of lungs! Hearing the vocalization the three of us looked at each other saucer eyed not saying a word. Each of us was hoping the others would pipe up with a logical explanation for what we had heard. Needless to say since we had been planning to leave anyway we beat a hasty retreat to the vehicles.,Bigfoot
Report 511: Daylight sighting by duck hunter near Pella.,Public Hunting Access about 3 miles south of Pella  IA in Marion County.,IA,Yesterday  October 24 my husband took our son duck hunting.  They were at a public access huntiong area in Marion county outside of the town of Pella.  My husband saw a crane and he was watching it fly away and pointing it out to our son when he saw something run across the trail about 40 yards away.  He said it was solid white and tall.  It was on two legs and very fast.  He said the weirdest thing was how fast and quiet it was  almost as if it couldn't have been there because it didn't make sense.  He said he got a weird feeling because it was just so odd and he had our son sit down and he loaded his gun and went to see if he could see anything at all of it or foot prints to indicate what it was.  However it was gone and there were no prints as there are leaves all over the place.  I told him it sounded like bigfoot stories my dad read to me as a child and my husband said he doesn't believe in bigfoot but it was just too fast to see its features.  Just two legs and running upright.  It was too fast for a man and so quite with the leaves and all.  My husband said he doesn't want to look like an idiot and hear the jokes so he is not going to ask around about it and he isn't sure he would say it was a sasquatch because he has never thought they existed but he cant think of anything else that does exist that it looked like unless a super fast man in a big white hairy suit  with the grace and quiet of a ballet dancer was running through the woods.  Are there any authentic sasquatch reports of a white one?  I don't know a lot about it but my husband is not one to get scared outdoors or to make up things.  So  I know he saw something strange.  Please mail me as to whether or not they are all white in color.,Bigfoot

Report 44740: Memory told of being chased off by frightening thumps and scream while hiking in Pikes Peak State Park,,IA,This is an old report  but recently after watching the better bigfoot programs on tv  it dawned on me that what we had experienced was a bigfoot. Every September  my husband I would go hiking to see the color.  This trip was in September  1970 to Pikes Peak State Park located on the highest bluff on the Mississippi River in Iowa. September is a time when the kids are back in school.  There was only one other car in the parking lot so the trails were deserted. Pikes Peak had several walking trails.  We decided to take the longest which led to the overlook on the Mississippi.  We had hiked almost to the point of the overlook.  Fall had us crunching on the fallen leaves when we heard a large thump  thump  thump from behind the trees followed by a loud animal scream that we had never experienced before.  Having hiked in the woods almost weekly  we learned to identify most of the animal sounds around us.  This was not an identifiable animal. The screech scared us so badly that we immediately turned around and ran as fast as we could all the way back to the rangers station.  Having reached the station we immediately inquired about the animal we had encountered.  We explained in great detail what had happened  but the rangers said they had no clue what we had encountered and that nothing similar had ever been reported. To this day I am still haunted by the sound of the footsteps and the screech.  Until the bigfoot programs I had never considered that what we had encountered could be a bigfoot.  Now I'm 90% sure of my identification. I also noticed that there were no other sightings in the same area.  Perhaps we were just at the right time and the right place  but I know what we experienced. Although late  previously I was unaware of any reporting sites to relay our experience. I am excited to hear your thoughts.,Bigfoot
Report 3049: Atv riders hear daytime vocalization and find tracks near Keokuk,Grandparents property.  Request location not be listed  but will gladly show area to a researcher.,IA,This incident involved hearing and smelling what my brothers and I can only describe as Bigfoot.  It happened on my Grandparents property when I was approx. 14 years old.  Our Grandparents had given all three of us 3-wheelers for Christmas the following year.  It had to be sometime between February and July of 1985 (Est. year  can not recall exact date).  My brothers (at the time ages 12 and 9)  were all on our 3-wheelers down by the creek behind my Grandparents home.  We had just gotten off of the ATV's and were going to cut through the woods to go up to my Grandmothers antique store  when we smelled something so putrid  it reminded us of sewage.  I remember telling my brothers that something really stank at about the time they smelled the odor.  Seconds later  we all heard a very loud  gutterral roar.  We froze in terror  looking at one another for what may have been only seconds  but seemed like several minutes.  Then we all raced up the hill to our Grandparents house  leaving our ATV's down by the creek.  We told our Grandparents and parents what we had smelled and heard  and we went back down to the creek with our Father and Grandfather  but could not find anything.  The odor was still in the air  and my Father and Grandfather could both smell it.  We took our ATV's back up to the house  and went home shortly after that.  That evening  it rained  and the next day  our eperience still racing in our minds  we went back to the creek to look for footprints.  We did not find any down there  but while riding on another section of the property  we found what appeared to be very large footprints  resembling a human foot  only much longer and wider and deeper.  The prints were located in a new driveway at the front of my Grandparents property.  The drive was made of black cinders  and the prints were very noticeable.  We returned to the house  and got a ruler and our Mom  who went with us to see the prints.  Frankly  she was amazed.  I imagine she was quite suprised to see actual prints  and if she had any doubts about the story we told the day before  they vanished when she took us to the local Jacks store to get Plaster of Paris to make plaster casts of the prints.  Unfortunately  the casts did not set up well in the black cinder  probably due to how hot the cinders got in the sun  and when we tried to remove the plaster casts  the casts crumbled.  We had measured the prints prior to the casting  and they measured 13 inches long by 8 inches wide by 2.5 inches deep.  My Grandpa  whom at the time weighed roughly 250 lbs.  could not even leave a print in the cinders.  We guessed that whatever made the tracks must have weighed around 400 to 600 lbs.  We never mentioned it to anyone outside the family  mostly because we were afraid of skepticism.  When one of my brothers  who is now 28 and a Deputy Sheriff  got hooked up to the internet recently  showed me your site  I decided to report our incident.,Bigfoot

Report 71863: Elk hunters hear loud wood knocks from multiple directions in remote forest 40 miles east of Boise,43.71597  -115.39289.  It is 2.5 hours from the nearest gas station in Idaho City so very remote.,ID,"While mule deer hunting in Idaho  I road my atv to the snow line on road 255 southwest of Atlanta. I passed a truck with Alaska plates. It was parked on the side of the road with no one around just where the snow started. I was forced to turn around due to deep snow about a mile from the truck up hill from it.  I observed many large elk tracks in the snow so I decided to move down in elevation to glass the timber strips.  Elk season started in 3 days so I want to see if any were in this area. Once at the location about a half mile down hill past the truck  I parked on the side of the road. About 5 minutes into my search I heard a knock to my right about level with me about 300 yards away (guess). Very loud and solid.  I first thought it was two trees hitting each other from wind. The wind was light though.  About 5 minutes later it happened again but the knock sounded different and a bit lower. Within 10 minutes the Alaska truck drove by me with just a driver.  He headed down elevation from me. I continued to glass this area without a sound for a good 5 minutes. I heard a vehicle coming up the hill and that person stopped to talk to me.  He was a friend of mine from my old home town in California.  Small world.  I knew he liked this area and was happy to see him.  We started to compare our hunting apps on our phones. Come to find out he was camped about 1.5 miles from my camp. We talked for a few minutes and then a loud knock like I heard before.  A bit closer and near level to us.  He stopped mid sentence for a second and turned to the direction of the sound but kept talking. A truck came by with a family in it and stopped to talk. I told him the snow situation and he headed up.  He returned within 5 minutes and headed down the road to lower elevation. We heard 1 more knock lower and like further away (not as loud) after the truck passed us.  My friend said  ""What the hell is that??""   I joked  ""Bigfoot!""  He immediately said it is someone splitting wood. When we heard 3 more in the next 20 minutes I told him that wood cutter sure takes his time between splits. Then it happened....a knock behind us with a different tone and it seemed farther away..  Then another below and to our right but not as loud as the other knocks. Things went quiet for 10 minutes. We said see you later.  He headed up the road toward the snow line. It didn't take long and he was back and drove by me with a wave.  I have not talked to him since then. Within 5 minutes of him driving by me I heard 3 distinct quick clacks or knocks directly behind me up the hill. Like rock not wood. Then 1 faint wood knock below me.  I stayed for about 15 minutes in silence  then left. ",Bigfoot
Report 12158: Young boy views bigfoot through window,Pine Lakes ranch  approx 5 miles north of Cascade about 2 miles off of Hwy 55,ID,"When I was 8 years old while living in a forested portion of central Idaho  my little brother and I got up on a snowy February morning at dawn to watch cartoons. It was to early and only a test pattern was on the TV. We turned off the TV and my brother went back upstairs to bed. I opted to stay on the couch in my warm blankets and wait untill the cartoons started. The couch was positioned along an outside wall beneath a row of 3' wide x 5' tall picture windows. These windows were approximately  7 feet from the ground on the outside. The 19"" TV was sitting on top of a tall wood storage box next to the wood stove directly across from the couch. I could see the reflection of the windows in the darkened TV screen. I dozed off for a while and was awakened by a noise which I thought was the snow sliding off the metal roof. I noticed a shadow shape in the window reflection nearest the stairs and at first thought it was a snow bank created by the snow off the roof. Then I saw the shadow move on to the next window and then it stopped at the window just past the head of the couch. I listened and heard some movement outside and also a sort of grunting noise. My heart started to race as I watched the mirrored reflection in the TV screen. Curiosity got the better of me and I sat up on my knees on the couch  leaned over the armrest  and looked out the window. I will never forget what I saw! There  just a few feet away was a sasquatch peering in the window. It was scanning the room with obvious curiosity. After a couple of seconds it sensed my movement and looked directly into my eyes. The face looked like a gorilla but with longer hair and ""smarter eyes"". It was not like the dark black eyes you see on other forest animals. Terrified  I dove off the couch and scurried on my hands and knees toward the bottom of the staircase. I tried to call out for my mom but my voice didn't work. I was afraid the bigfoot would hear me. Finally  I gave out a few meager calls and my mom finally appeared on the balcony above the room. ""What's the matter?"" she said. ""There is a bigfoot outside."" I whispered. At that point I started to cry and shake. Sensing that something had terrified me   she said ""Well get up here then."" I was still afraid to move. She said she couldn't see anything outsde from up there  so I flew up the stairs using my hands and feet. My mom knew I wasn't joking around and she wouldn't let my brother and I outside to play in the snow untill later in the afternoon. My brother saw the holes in the snow where I thought the animal stood but snow had partially filled them and he wouldn't believe my story. Years later  a friend of my moms  who knew about my sighting  gave her an old local newspaper with a story in it about multiple bigfoot sightings occuring with in a 30 mile radius of home during that 1979 time period.",Bigfoot
Report 6983: Hunter has early morning sighting near Challis,Just north of Challis  Idaho and south of the Salmon River Wilderness.,ID,We were on a hunting trip with about 10 people near Challis  Idaho  south of the Salmon River Wilderness  in October 1975. We had stopped our trucks on a dirt road on our way back to camp following our morning hunt to “work” these hillsides that converged at a stream near the road. To our knowledge  there were no other hunters in that area. Four of us went up into the hills to make a giant circle to try to scare up some game and drive them back down towards the stream where the others were waiting. Being young  I volunteered to be a hiker. As we split up  I thought three of them went up the backside of one hill while I circled the other. As I came over the ridge  I found myself on a very steep  shale-covered slope about 500 feet above the stream. As I was scared of sliding all the way to the bottom on my butt  I sat down to watch the opposite slope while my dad and the other 2 worked that hill. As I sat there  I saw what I thought was one of our hunting party walk across the slope  about 100 feet below the ridgeline. He crossed the hillside  near the ridgeline  on the hill across a large ravine from me. That hill was taller than the one I was on. I remember thinking  “boy  he is going to get shot  dressed in dark clothing like that!” It kind of made me mad because he was walking a rather brisk pace  not even stopping to look around for game. I watched him through my riflescope  and for the life of me  I couldn't see any rifle in his hands. My dad had brought along one of our neighbors who had very little experience hunting  and I figured it was that guy. After about 30 minutes  I saw my dad and his other buddy come into view. They were much lower on the slope and I estimated their range to be about 400 yards  but seemed to be smaller in comparison to the other figure I had seen earlier. We waved at each other to work our way back towards the others. When we got back to the trucks  the neighbor  of course  was late in arriving. While waiting for him  dad was joking about seeing him walking along the ridge with his rifle still in it's zippered case  as is was raining lightly. I told him that I thought I had seen him  but saw no rifle and almost shot at him as he was dressed in dark clothing. Dad said “He had an orange vest and orange cap on  and how did you see him when he was above and behind you?” I said  “No  he was above and behind you.” When the neighbor with the clean and dry rifle returned  he confirmed my dad's report. So I said  “Well then  who was that I saw?” Everyone was too tired and wet to care. We went back to camp and forgot all about it  until the other day. Now I'm starting to wonder all over again. Since whoever/whatever I saw was probably 500 yards or so from me  I had trouble making out much detail. I had a variable 3 X 9 power scope. After I saw him I cranked the power all the way to 9 and watched him cross the open hillside without obstruction for probably a full minute or so until he disappeared behind the trees. I was watching his entire left profile. He walked rather quickly and did not turn to look at me  as far as I could tell. He did not appear to have much difficulty traversing the terrain  but when my dad walked across  it looked like he was having the same problem as I was with the steep slope and rocks that slide when you step on them. It took dad forever to cross the same amount of space as this other guy  and dad appeared to be much smaller  even though he was obviously somewhat closer to me. Dad was probably 50 feet or so lower in elevation than I was. As far as estimating height  my dad is 6ft tall  and this thing was much taller and broader...but not fat...kinda “lanky”. A really rough estimate would be at least 8ft. tall  with really long arms that he/she swung like a cross-country skier as he walked.  and taking rather long strides as well.,Bigfoot
Report 28714: Memory told of seeing a bigfoot on the side of a road along Middle Branch Creek,,IL,Years ago I had a strange experience as a kid. I was ten years old and I remember it was the summer time. My bedtime was 8:30 so I knew this had to have happened later in the evening as I was already in my pajamas. It was dark outside. My ex-brother-in-law had an old pick-up truck that he was always having problems with. He called my mom and asked if she could come get him as he had broken down. We got into the car  me in my pajamas and we headed out one of the country roads that is east of Norris. As we got nearer the creek (Middle Fork of Copperas Creek) and woods there is a curve in the road. After coming out of the curve the headlights shined onto something that was crouched down behind the fence and near a fencepost. We couldn't tell what it was but it's head did stick up above the four foot fence. It appeared to be watching my brother-in-law whose truck was just ahead of us. When we got to the truck we told him about it. He grabbed a rifle he had with him and strapped a flashlight onto it with some duct tape. I went with him as as he took off to see what this unusual creature was. He moved his flashlight back and forth near the fence and that is when it stood up. It was really tall and was on two feet. It immediately took off running into the woods that were close- by. In two or three steps it was gone.,Bigfoot
Report 24997: Hiker has nighttime sighting near Carlyle,,IL,While strolling through the timber on a warm fall night  I came up the slight incline from the river bank and heard a scream coming from due east. My immediate thought with respect to the sound was that it was a bobcat. I froze in my tracks and looked toward the sound in time to see whatever it was jump from about 6 or 8 feet up in a tree to the ground. It landed on its hind legs  took 3 or 4 steps  then went to all fours and ran faster than I have ever seen anything run into the treeline. When I saw that it was completely gone  I ran as fast as I could perpendicularly to the highway.,Bigfoot

Left side,IL,While driving my work van just as I was coming over the top of the hill (over pass) a tall dark figure passed in the tree line. It was walking too tall for a human. It was maybe 7 to 8 foot range because it was at the mid point of the trees. There isn't a rise there it's flat I checked because I drive this way 5 days a week twice a day. I watched it walk for several seconds until it disappeared into thicker tree growth. Was stopped due to bridge construction (flagman).,Bigfoot
Report 40995: Possible sighting of animal playing peek-a-boo at Argyle Lake State Park.,The following sighting occurred at Argyle Lake State Park,IL,"When the sighting happened we had come down into a bottom near a stream.  The main thing we first noticed was that the entire woods had gone silent.  Before we had heard bird calls and insects throughout the woods.  The silence was really unsettling and we felt like we were being watched.  We got a little unnerved and began to walk quicker towards where we had parked the car.  As we walked the road back we could hear something about 20-30 feet behind and off to the side of us moving through the brush and undergrowth.  Then at one point we had a rather nasty smell blow through the area  similar to a skunk or fox when they musk or spray.  At one point we know it crossed the road behind us and rather quickly because the noises changed which side of the road they were coming from.  At one point we were certain it was going to walk out into the open right in front of us but then all the sound stopped for a short period of time until we went down the next hill.  When we got ready to go around the last bend to where we had parked I took a look back and saw ""something"" squatting on a point next to a dead blackened tree which stood  around three to four feet tall.  The top of it came to right around the top of the dead tree and it was fairly wide.  The only thing I could misidentify it as was a black bear and they haven't been seen in our area for well over 50-100 years.  I caught a quick glance at it and then turned back around told my friend I saw something and to just keep walking quickly straight ahead and for the car.  Once we got around the bend we ran for the car  jumped in and took off.  Since then we've never really talked about it.",Bigfoot
Report 27692: Mushroom hunter hears vocalizations and finds footprints near Jubilee College State Park,,IL,"Well  I went out hunting with my Lab  I got a full-blooded Lab  my dog. And as usual I went out on a Wednesday. It was a nice sunny day out  nice weather  around 72 degrees  75 degrees  very good weather. I drove back into the area where I've been hunting every year for the last 20 years. And that's when I had an experience. The dog kept acting up. And I also noticed a kind of a stench smell and I thought maybe it was something dead. And I kept hearing something of more of like a grunt noise. So I kept hearing that and as I heard that I thought maybe somebody was playing jokes or something on me or playing a prank but then I realized there was nobody else I knew out there  there weren't any other vehicles so I went ahead and started looking around  for mushrooms. I walked maybe less than ten feet and I heard a few more grunt noises toward me and they seemed like they weren't that far off  I had that feeling that someone was watching me and as I stood there I heard it went from a grunt to  oh I would say  a loud more of a scream or yell. I have never heard nothing like that in my life before. And it proceeded twice after it did it the first time it did it again a few seconds later and then I heard three like movements in the trees  like cracking and the brush was moving and lo and behold here comes my Lab running back  with the hair all the way up from her neck and all the way down to her tail  and her tail all the way between her legs and her head down and she was looking towards the area where I had heard the noise. The dog was scared  I have never seen my dog ever act like that. That is when it kind of scared me because I thought if the dog is that scared what is it? Well then I ended up getting in the vehicle  it scared me and I still had that feeling I was being watched. I got in the vehicle and backed my truck all the way up the road that is along side a corn and soybean field I backed up and proceeded towards the back entrance where I came in and I parked it almost mile from where I was actually at when I had these experiences and I went on the opposite side of the corn field. As I went over there I thought I will hunt over here  it seems like it is more open  a lot of thickets and brush but not as thick as where I was at and it was quite away off and there was still plenty of daylight  sunshine. When I got out and walked down in there I looked across the creek and the water was probably no more than four or five inches deep. And there isn't really a lot traffic over there and when I walked I couldn't believe my eyes I seen footprints  actual footprints  and I knew it couldn't be human  a human wouldn't have walked in that area barefoot  for one there is too many thickets and he would have been crazy if he did and two it was so big Shaq couldn't have a foot that big. The first one I found was the right foot and the big toe you could see it very clear  and the other one was four feet away and it was the left foot. On it you could see the heel and the toes. Basically after that I came the next day. My son-in-law  who is an ex-police officer  wanted to go out. He was a non-believer and a skeptic and basically didn't believe me. He wanted me to prove to him I wasn't lying. So I said  ""I'll let you be the judge  maybe I'm making a mistake  maybe I didn't see what I seen."" We went out the next day and found other tracks that were in the same area from where I found the first set of tracks. So instead of finding two sets of footprints we found like six of them. They were all scattered in an area within fifty yards along the creek. That was on May 6th  which was a Thursday.",Bigfoot

My husband had photography work to do and was being transferred to Indiana. In the fall of 1997 while driving south on Hwy 41 near Turkey Run State Park in IN  my husband and I saw what we affectionately call ""A something"". It was a misty night and we were headed for Terra Haute. I was driving my Ford Aerostar Van with my husband in the passenger seat (I was glad he was on that side) we also had our two year old son in the back seat. ""It"" was walking in the gully. ""It"" stood taller than the van so to speculate on the height I would say over 6"" easily. The body was black and hairy although the face was huge and long in the jaw shaped like a knight of a chess piece but not like a horse! My husband describes the face more like a lions shape. We passed it and continued our trip - and later even moved here with our child going to Turkey Run School.

Report 24815: Man recalls his observation of a creature crossing a road while hunting in the Morgan-Monroe State Forest,Hindustan is the nearest village (only a few homes and small church) perhaps 3-4 miles away on Old 37. The town of Martinsville is about 5 miles to the north and the town of Bloomington is about 15 miles to the south. This incident took place in the Morgan-Monroe State Forest on the Main Forest Road about 1 or 1.5 miles east of the forest entrance that is off of the State Road Old 37.,IN,"This took place while on the last day of firearm deer season in Novemeber  1988.  It was after sunset but not yet dark.  The temperature was in the mid 30's but the ground wasn't frozen and there were still patches of snow on the ground in places.  I came out of the woods  put my shotgun  heavy winter coat  and daypack in the trunk of my car and got inside my car to start it up when a movement to my left caught my eye. I will tell you what I saw and what I thought as I was seeing this happen.  This man/bigfoot came out of thick brush between the trees to my left on the opposite side of the road from where I was parked  maybe thirty five or forty yards down the road at an angle but it had to know that I was there or at least that my car was there. When I first saw this thing coming out of the thick brush the first thing I thought was  where in the heck did he come from....  Then  I thought  stupid guy  no hunter orange and then I began to notice strange things like he had no gun  and that he was the same color from head to toe  no hat  no hunter orange?  But then what I really noticed was that his arms were long  his hands were swinging at his knees and though he was taking large steps crossing the road very quickly but without running  he was just walking.  His arms were swinging wide like a British soldier marching but he didn't seem to be in any hurry and he completely ignored me like I wasn't there but he had to know that I was there.  He did not look over and kept his head looking straight ahead. He went into the woods on my side of the road (side I was parked on) and went down the hill and disappeared.  My eyes told me that I just saw a bigfoot but my brain and common sense was trying to dispute that.  His color was dark brown and I thought could that have been a man in a one piece Carhartt outfit or if he were a hiker lost wouldn't he just have stayed on the road rather than go down a steep hill when it was almost dark or if lost why didn't he ask me for help?  He was about six feet tall but very husky with his hands  body  feet  side of his head-face  all one color.  I actually couldn't see fur because the light was dim.  I could see the trees and tree trunks fine but not the bark because the tree trunks were silhoutetted and that's what I mean about not seeing the fur  it was all one shade of dark brown.  Now  all of this that I just told you took place in a minute or less.  Soon as it disappeared over the side of the hill I jumped out of my car  opened the trunk and loaded my shotgun (for self-defense only)  put on my winter coat  and got my flashlight out of my day pack and walked to where I thought the thing went over the hill.  I wanted to check out what I just saw and was hoping to find a footprint in the ground or on a patch of snow and I went slowly back and forth  traversing this rather steep hill going a little deeper down as I moved back and forth.  There was a deep like gorge on the right side of the hill and I looked up towards the road and by now the ridge on top was just a slither of gray and looking over my shoulder I realized this was not too smart  it was pitch black below me and I got a little scared and hiked back up to the road and to my car as fast as I could.  I placed my shotgun back in the case along with my heavy coat putting them in the truck and then I drove up and down the main forest road to see if there were any cars parked off on the sides or if there were anyone walking  I saw nothing.  I drove to the valley road where I thought this thing would eventually come out at the bottom of the hill into farm fields and I drove back to the end of this valley and back hoping to see something but saw nothing.  I have been wanting to make a report of what I saw and have told my wife  children  teenage granddaughters  brother  and two close hunting buddies  but have always been hesitant to make a report.  The truth is  though I am sure what I saw wasn't a man I can't prove it wasn't a man dressed up in a suit but who would be that stupid especially during hunting season. I can't say positively that it was a bigfoot but that is what my eyes saw.  Logic says ""no""  my eyes say  ""yes"" and that's my report the best that I can remember it.  I am glad to get this off my chest.  If this helps in any way then that's great but please use only my first name if this is posted  I am not seeking notoriety here  thanks.  Sincerely  [name removed]",Bigfoot
Report 29032: Memory told of a mid-afternoon encounter along the Flatrock River,It was a small little campground along Flatrock River in a secluded part of northwestern Decatur County close to Rush and Shelby County.,IN,"This happened to me and a friend of mine. It was a clear spring day. We were at a campground where my parents camped in a secluded part of our county. It was a Wednesday  so most adults were at work. We pitched horseshoes and messed around while the dogs that hung around the campground all played. I had a .22 rifle of my brothers with some shells. My friend and I went down to river as it was traveling at a slow pace and I through in a pop can. We took target practice at the can. I had one shot left and the can was pretty far down the river when I noticed how quiet it was. I put the gun on safety and ask my friend when is the last time you ever heard complete silence in the woods. No birds  no nothing. The first noise we heard came from across the river. It kept getting louder and I told my friend that I was going to get the .22 shells that were on the picnic table up the bank by the horseshoe pit. I was halfway to the picnic table and I heard this loud noise and my friend hightailing it up the hill saying ""There it is!"" I froze in my tracks and my friend stood right behind me. There stood this Bigfoot with one foot in the water and one on the bank. It had rusty reddish-brown hair which hung down over its eyes like a sheep dog. We stood frozen and so did it for around five minutes. I told my friend to take a good look because for the rest of our lives people are going to laugh at us for what we are now witnessing. I had one shot still in the chamber. I took the safety off and told my friend to run to the car when I fire the gun. I first aimed the gun at the Bigfoot and it did not move. I debated for awhile then decided that this creature was not trying to hurt me so I shot up in the air. We ran to the car and drove straight home. I told my mom and she did not believe me at first. I  still to this day  want to take a lie detector so bad to prove to them and everyone that I did  in fact  have a loaded gun aimed at a Bigfoot and decided not to shoot. I still don't own a gun and I am fifty and I definitely do not hunt. The following Sunday was the Fathers' Day and my brother-in-law  who was nineteen went across the river in a rowboat to check things out. There were footprints everywhere. Only ""four"" toes. I wear a size thirteen shoe and I could put my foot in these prints with a couple of inches longer and wider to spare. My brother-in-law at the time  found a clump of hair that matched the description of what I saw stuck in the bark of a tree a couple of hundred yards into the woods by the cornfield. A tree had fell down and was stuck in an angle into another tree and it was about 7 foot up on the tree that was leaning. He put it in a plastic ziploc and to this day  I don't know what he ever did with that sample. I told this to an Amish man who does not live far from where this happerned in the mid-90's and he told me that one of the men in his congregation had also spotted this creature along the river around that same time. I am an honest  sensible man. I know what I saw and nothing will ever change my mind.",Bigfoot
Report 15926: Possible vocalization/intimidation at Ouabache State Park,,IN,This happened at Oubache State Park near Bluffton Indiana either the summer of 1989 or 1990. I was working as a night watchman at the front gate and had been watching television when I decided that I needed to get something out of my Ford Bronco. The area leading up to the park is heavily forested with trees that had been planted by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Depression. The road leading into the park was about a third of a mile long. As I stepped outside the booth and was crossing the road to the parking lot  I heard the most terrifying scream that I have ever heard in my life about 250 yards to the southwest of my location. At the same time that I heard the scream I also heard a tree snap and break and fall to the ground. The tree sounded to be quite large. The weather that night was very calm and there was no wind at all which could account for this tree falling down. I quickly turned around and headed back for my booth and sat down to think about what just happened. I felt like I was in a daze for a few minutes as I was trying to think what a logical explaination of this event could be. I sat there for about 45 minutes and after I had settled down a bit  I decided that it must have been my imagination playing tricks on me and I proceeded to head back out to my truck. I was walking toward my truck and had gotten to the exact same spot that I was in previously when I heard the horrible scream when I heard it once again and this time it was about 50 yards away from my booth. I once again quickly retreated to my booth and sat there until daylight. Once day light arrived I walked out in the woods to investigate but found nothing out of the ordinary. I didn't walk far enough out to find the tree as I was still quite unsettled by what I heard. I have heard screech owls and bobcats but nothing  absoultely nothing  that compares to the sound that I heard that night. I can't say to this day what it might have been  but this has bothered me for about 16 years and I still think of it evey now and then. Reading about some of the other sighitngs that people have heard and the sounds that they said this creature made makes me think of my own experience and I wonder if I too actually had an encounter.,Bigfoot

Report 65984: Hunter's dusk sighting of a sasquatch on the Kickapoo (KS) Indian Reservation,Location on Map: 39.680008  -95.696218,KS,"While bow hunting in a field in Kansas  I observed something that I could only describe as a Sasquatch. I was sitting on a stool next to a round bail of hay near the tree line. I was near a deer scrape. As I sat watching the tree line to no avail  it began to get too dark to see my fiber optic pins on my bow. So  I began gathering my gear to make my move to my vehicle. My friend was hunting farther up the tree line in the timber. After gathering my belongings there was still enough light to see an opening near a corn patch. As I stood up I saw a figure which I thought was my hunting buddy. I said in a normal voice  ""Did you see anything?"" The figure did not reply. Upon further observation I saw that it was walking in my general direction. It stopped next to a round bail and I realized that the figure was at least 3-4 foot taller than the bail of hay. I began moving toward the tree line as to not silhouette myself. As the figure was closing the distance to 100-125 yards I began to make out body features. The head was kind of high with no visual neck  broad shoulders which tapered down to a slim looking torso. The outline of the body allowed me to see that his arms  shoulders  legs were extremely muscular  like that of a professional athlete. The arms were longer than normal and he walked in silence. As I stood there trying to figure out who or what I was seeing  I never had a sense of fear. I had my iPhone on me but it never dawned on me to make video because I was in what felt like a dream like trance or shock. As I realized what I may be seeing I hastily skirted the tree line to my truck. As I approached my truck the first thing I did was open my palm and slapped the shit out of my tailgate. As  I hit my trucks tailgate I then observed the figure drop down on all fours and in four seconds flat it was gone. It either used the bails as cover or it was the fastest living thing I have ever seen move. After meeting with my buddy he informed me that he shot an arrow at a buck  but it ricochet off of the breast plate. He then informed me that the deer was going to run in my general direction toward the field but the buck stopped in his tracks and looked into the field  then turned around and came running back from the same direction that my buddy just shot at him from.",Bigfoot

It was hot  very hot weather. I heard sounds of deep heavy breathing...a weird sound I cannot really articulate  but it caused me to look up and around. I thought my dog (a Great Dane) who had followed my companion downstream was back panting heavily from running in the river. I realized the sound was coming from behind me. I turned around and saw a tall creature staring at me. I couldn't believe my what I was seeing. He was 100-150 feet West of me standing on the bank beside a tree. I could see his eyes very clearly. They were like a man's. He had hair around him and covering his face and his entire body. He was very tall at least 7 feet and built very athletically. We just stared at each other for several minutes. I had no weapon to protect myself so I just stood very still and so did he. I realized I had to do something. I dropped my fishing pole in the water and started to move sideways slowly downstream where I could barely see the person I had come with. As I did the creature moved very quickily to the next tree Northward  stopped and stared at me. I stopped. I wanted to move closer  but I was too scared. I thought  if I had a gun or something I would move toward it  but then it occurred to me this may be somebody in a suit! I thought it might be my brother. But  in this hot weather? I called out my brother's name  ""is that you? Quit kidding around!"" The creature simply stared at me. We were both curious about each other and I could tell  I don't know how that it was a male creature. Several more minutes passed and I knew I better get out of there. I moved slowly again  sideways and began softly calling to my companion  but he was so far downstream he couldn't hear me. I was afraid now  so I started moving faster to get out of there. The creature moved when I did and he move away from tree to tree and I made my way through the river to my companion. I yelled for him to get up here and told him what I saw. He thought I was crazy. When I finally got him up river to see  the creature was gone. We went up on the bank to look for prints  but I didn't see any  because it was all dry sandy soil. We immediately went home and I told my family  my brother was home and it was obviously not him. My family owned this part of the river for recreation at that time and it has become the family joke. But  I know what happened and I did see bigfoot in Kansas. It wasn't just a siting  but a long hard stare at each other. Of all the pictures I have seen of Bigfoot  there is only 1 that is true. This creature looks like a man  has eyes like a man and even if I would have had a gun  I would never shot it for fear that it would have been a man (a tall one) in some sort of suit.",Bigfoot

Report 34725: Ginseng hunter has an unexpected encounter near Blaine,,KY,"While looking through reports for Kentucky I came across report #11966 in Lawrence county  KY. I had a sighting/experience around the same time period and same area near Blaine  KY. I have never told anyone of this other than at the time it happened I told my wife I had been stalked out of the woods by something large and packed my family up  leaving the area. In 2003 my wife and I took our daughter and youngest son with our travel trailer to camp at Yatesville Lake State Park in Lawrence county Ky near Blaine. We arrived on a Friday in August with intent of fishing and I always go on ginseng hunts where I am able/allowed. I think it be noted I am an avid outdoorsman having hunted  fished  hiked  and camped in at least 28 states of the USA for 40+ years. I am well acquainted with big game animals including bears  mountain lions  elk  deer  and wild hogs. I stake my reputation on my word and kept this encounter to myself. On Saturday morning I took my family to fish in the lake at a spot where Highway 32 bridge crosses a fork of Blaine Creek. After my family was set up  I took off into the mountain on the southwest side of this bridge and possibly part of Yatesville Lake WMA to hunt ginseng. As I had worked my way up a long deep hollow and neared the top of the ridge and to my left I heard knocking like someone striking a piece of wood against a tree (similar to what researchers hear/do). I also had several rocks come through the trees from the top of a small cliff at the top of the ridge  but thought they had fell off the rock formations on their own. Then as I happened to look back behind me from the hollow I came out of on the far side of that ridge I saw a very large dark hair covered figure that was watching me and it was standing upright  it definately was not a bear. I estimated later it was near 8' tall  I'm also a carpenter and pretty good at measurements. As silly as it sounds  when it left my sight  I spoke aloud to this ""thing"" and said ""Old one I mean no harm and I'm only taking what I need"" all the while easing my way around and down toward my family  once I was out of eyesight I took off down the mountain as fast as I could  I could hear this ""bigfoot"" following at a distance. Once I got to my family I told my wife to get everything to gather and packed my family out of the area telling them a bear was stalking me off the mountain. It was not a bear and I guess I'm only reporting this now because of the other sightings in the area around the same time. BFRO is welcome to contact me and I would be willing to travel back to the exact spot and show where this occurred even though it was over 8 years ago. ",Bigfoot
Report 1024: An account of bigfoot tool use,,KY,"When I was young six years old  Ronnie Joe a friend of mine and myself was playing behind Ronnie's house.  We heard a thumbing sound and moved closer to see what was making the sound.  Just behind a neighbor's house we saw a big foot digging in the ground with a stick of fire wood  at times taking one stick of fire wood and pounding a second stick into the ground. Then he would turn the dirt over  using the stick like a spade. He may have been looking for food  but we never knew for sure. Then the bigfoot stood up and walked our way.  We were only 25ft. to 30ft. from the animal. It was showing its teeth but didn't make a sound.  This was a open field  bright sunshine lit day  nothing between us and the animal  so we got a good look but not a very long look at bigfoot. The animal had a dark brown coat with a lighter  almost grey vest.  He had large teeth and long ""dirty"" finger and toe nails. The nails looked very thick.",Bigfoot
Report 10765: Youth watches animal hiding behind trees near Nolin Lake.,At this moment I don't know the location because I was so young.,KY,"When I was around 10  11 or 12 (1975-77) Sorry  I don't remember exactly -- it's been a while. When I was a kid  My grandparents had a little bitty camper at a campsite at Nolin Lake. I couldn't tell you precisely where it was either. If I had to  I could probably get my father to tell me where it was  but that would mean I'd have to tell him this story ... Anyway ... one summer my father took the family (me  my sister and mother) to my grandparents site for a little vacation. One evening as it was becoming dusk  I remember standing inside the camper looking out the screen door at my father who was cooking at the grill. The campsite sat at the top of a hill in a wooded area. The woods consisted mostly of old growth  deciduous trees  so there weren't really any evergreens or shrub-type trees like cedars which could really block your view. So I was looking out the door at my father who was on my left and eventually  out of boredom I guess  I ended up scanning to the right and down the hill into the woods. I remember seeing about midway down the hill  something that caught my eye. You know how when you think you see something and in a split second your mind says  ""Did I just see what I THOUGHT I saw?"" Well that's what happened to me. There he was. Midway down the hill -- I'm getting chills right now typing this -- partially hidden behind a tree was this ""man thing"" I could see his whole head  his right shoulder and part of his leg coming out from behind the tree. He/it was grayish brown and he was looking right at me (Maybe not -- but it sure felt like he was looking at me) I looked away thinking I had to be imagining it but when I looked back  it was still there and I had no problem picking him out from the trees. At that point my mother who was cooking at the stove behind me said something to me and I turned around to talk to her. When I looked back outside down the hill  he was gone. I kept looking through all the trees  but I couldn't find him. After that I was scared. I didn't leave the camper the rest of the night. I was an avid comic book reader at the time  so I used that as an excuse to stay in. I remember I kept looking out the door that night just to check around and see if he came back and my parents kept asking me to come out and sit by the fire ... I didn't dare tell my parents about what I saw because my father's teasing is legendary in my family. He's the oldest of 7 boys so he REALLY nows how to get under your skin. What I saw was big and burley and it didn't make any sounds that I can remember. It had a big  squarish head (kind of blocky with rounded corners) that looked like it sat right on its shoulders. I really don't recall seeing a neck. I could see a massive shoulder and a thick bicep. I could also see its chunky hip and a good portion of its thigh down to about it's knee. All the rest was hidden behind the tree. From time to time I'll see an animal show that will feature a three toed sloth  and every time I see a sloth I always think  ""That sloth's hair looks like that bigfoot I saw when I was a kid"" If you want  I can draw what I saw if that helps any.",Bigfoot
Report 51739: Memory told of seeing the neighbor's dog going after a hairy biped while squirrel hunting near Greenup,,KY,"When I was 14  I had gotten up early one Saturday morning to go squirrel hunting on a small piece of property by my parents house. This stretch of woods is located in Greenup County Kentucky in Northeastern KY. The property is bordered by a small creek ""Raccoon Creek""  and a river  the ""Little Sandy"". I hunted this area on a daily basis when I was younger and had never seen anything unusual. On this particular day in early September  there was a heavy dew on the trees so it was easy to hear anything moving as the dew would fall and make a very distinct noise. I was walking down the ridge top overlooking Raccoon creek and had not made any noise since arriving way before daylight. As often happened  my neighbors dog followed me that day and I thought I had ran him off a couple of hours earlier. Everything was completely still with almost no wind that morning. I started to hear the dog  ""Gruffy  start barking and growling in a way that I had never heard before. At first I tried to ignore the noise but after a few minutes I decided to go run him off again as he was destroying my hunt. As I quietly eased down the ridge about 50 yards  I saw what I thought to be a young bear through the trees. The animal was standing on it's back legs and was only around 6' tall. I noticed that as Gruffy would lunge at the animal it would knock him back with its hands. He would let out a yelp and then go back after the animal. I eased closer being as quiet as possible planning to shoot near the animal to keep it from killing the dog. As I got directly above the animal it noticed me and turned to look directly at me. This is when I noticed that it was not a bear. I did not immediately distinguish the animal as a Sasquatch but was very confused as to what I was looking at. The animal growled visciously which scared me more than I have ever been scared. When Gruffy noticed me he ran to me and kept barking at the animal. I thought about shooting the animal but decided that with a 20 gauge shotgun at this distance with #6 shot that I would just tick it off. I started to walk backward slowly. After 3-4 steps the animal let out a blood curdling growl. I literally threw my shotgun down and ran home. When I got home  I told my father about what had happened. After he got over the fact that my gun was still in the woods  he decided to grab his rifle and take me back to get the gun. He would not accept that this was anything other than a bear. I have never spoken of this encounter because if my father would not believe me then who would? Although black bears are in the area  I have only seen one in the wild in the area. I have been an avid hunter my entire life and hunt everything from Ginseng and Yellow Root to big game. I still am not entirely sure of what I saw that day but I know it was not a bear and it was not a human. A human couldn't possibly make the sounds that this animal made at the volume it made them.",Bigfoot
Report 5678: Woman recalls childhood sighting near Warfield,Far back in the mountains in eastern Kentucky.  It is possible strip mining has destroyed the area.  I've been away for 40 years or so.,KY,When I saw this creature  I was told not to tell anybody or they would think I was crazy!! In 1950 when I was 12 years old   I lived in a little hamlet called Beauty located in eastern Kentucky  located along the border of the Tug River. We children played in the mountains almost all summer long.  We had heard of a rock cliff back up on the hill that had a cave in it and we decided to go looking for this cliff with the cave.   Being kids  we didn't keep track of how far we climbed or what ridges we went on  but finally we reached this cliff.  We were standing at the base looking up through the shadows of the trees when I noticed there was someone standing up on the rock (about 10 feet up)  looking back at us. He was  I judge about 6 feet tall.   Muscular.  His arms were longer than a humans.His legs about like a human. He had hair much like a chimps hair grows on its arms and legs. NOT the fuzzy hair like a bear.  His chest seemed to be pretty hairless.   Very hairy around the genital area so one could not tell if he was male or female....but I didn't see any breasts so I judged it to be male.    He was holding a heavy stick in his hand as he stood there looking down at us.   I could not see his facial features.    I would say that he was an intelligent being from the way he behaved. He stood looking at us for about 15 seconds then he stepped back out of our sight and was gone.   It was not until I was an adult that I realized what I had seen. I believe this being knew we were children....I believe he allowed us to see him because we did not present him any danger.   Of course we yelled and tore up the bushes running back off that hill!!   I told my grandma that we had seen a gorilla and she told me people would think I was crazy.   So I kept it to myself what I had seen.,Bigfoot
Report 23227: Daylight sighting by squirrel hunter outside Sarepta,about 2 miles behind my old home place on bayou bodcaw,LA,While squirrel hunting on Bayou Bodcaw on a clear and sunny morning  I heard dogs running what I thought was a deer on the west side of the creek. I was standing on the east side appx. 20 ft from the bank looking for squirrel in cypress den trees. The creek was about 30 to 40 yards wide with banks 10 to 12 ft high. As the dogs drew closer I put a 12 ga 00 buckshot in my shotgun. I then saw what I thought was a person break through some bursh and slide down the bank almost to the water. It then crawled back up the bank and turned and looked my way. This creature had reddish brown hair all over its body about the length of a deer's hair. It stood appx. 6 to 6.5 feet tall. Due to its hair I could only make out its nose and eyes features. After a few seconds it turned north and jogged up the creek until it was out of sight. The next day I told my dad about this. He asked why I didn't shoot it.  I told him it looked too much like a man.,Bigfoot

Report 1461: Witnesses saw Creature next to a Broken Tree,This sighting occured in a community in Central Louisiana. Outside the city limits of Pineville near a swamp area. Between Hwy 107 and Hwy 167.,LA,This was in the early 80s late spring early summer. i was still in High school ( Graduated in 1983)  Myself my two brothers and my best friend and his two brothers were in a field with our dogs goofing off on top of a hill over looking a swamp bottom.We had been talking about and wondering why the cattle that stayed in this field never went to certain part of the field.( the area we were looking at).(We jokingly called this the Devils corner because of this).On this particular day the cattle had wandered into this area and were grazing. After about 10-15 mins of us sitting at the top of the hill talking about this we noticed that a few of the cattle looked very anxious and were looking toward the fence row that bordered the swamp area. We all started getting excited that the cows were scared of something  when all of a sudden the herd startled and began running up the hill out of that corner and bottom. Since we were in their path we moved and watched them run back to ward the south end of the field. Being curious we gathered up some weapons (logs sticks rocks) and decided to go see what was there  not expecting to see anything. We crossed the bottom and started toward the fence row.We noticed that it was extremely quiet in that corner of the field . We began to look around when we noticed some reddish hair stuck to the barbs on the fence.Then thought hey there are no reddish colored cows so why is this hair this color and on the top row of 4 row barb wire fence ( fence was 5 ft at the highest point) we then heard something moving in the woods (very thick and dense lots of thorns)where the hair was at. At this time i noticed that a pine tree roughly 5inches in diameter had been twisted and knocked over about 8-10 feet up.We hadnt had any storms recently and no other trees were damaged. We decided we should leave.As we started to leave my the younger boys threw there stuff down and began running me  but me and my friend didnt. I then had the feeling that we were being watched i asked my friend if he felt that as well and he said yeah  i turned toward the fence to see a face about 7ft up standind next to the broken tree i asked my friend if he saw it as well and said uh huh  we stared at it for about 2 mins before we ran away. What i saw was 2 eyes a gray/white color with reddess hair the top of the head was hiddien by brush the bridge of the nose was very apparent straight long and narrow the rest was hidden from view. After that we never said anything about it again.About a month later my friend decided he was going back in there to look around with his dog.(this is the same dog that was with us the first time and acted very afraid and this dog has chased many animal in that field) I wnet to the fence row by the broken tree with him but told him i was not going in there with him and that id wait there for him.He said he'd be back later.After he crossed the fence i lost sight of him about 5ft in. No sooner had i lost sight of him i hear movement to the left of the spot he went in  shortly after this i heard him come running back to the fence row  he was yelling i saw it  i saw it..he jumped that barbed wire fence in stride with his dog hot on his heels. From that day on we never went to that area again. Later on that fall we had found a calf in the swamp that had been ripped open and the guts had been pulled out but not eaten.We passed it off as wild dogs or coyotes/wolves. Later that winter we had a snow (unusual) and again found another calf that was the same way but in another area of the field. We also passed this off as wild dogs  coyotes/wolves. But since reading about the deer kills in other states i began to think that these calves had been done the same way.We never talked to anybody about what we saw.Except the calves. That wooded area has since been cleared/thinned and but the swamp is still there.This swamp has access to Bayou Marie Cedar lake  and the Red River.My parents still live there so i visit the area every month.,Bigfoot
Report 1516: Unknown animal with loud scream visits lake front home  frightens dog; something heavy is heard walking in the water,Lake Bistineau  outside of Shreveport near a town called Koran  not far from Houghton,LA,"This occurred approximately 18-19 years ago when I was about 13 or 14--probably 1979. My mother and I were inside our home. The time was probably close to dusk  there was still a little bit of daylight left. The next thing that I remember was that my mother said"" that it was awful quiet outside all of a sudden."" Then we heard the dog  start howling and scratching to get into the house  which was remarkable in its' own rights because this dog was tied to a stake in the yard. This was a Big German Shepard that had to be tied up because if he ran loose  he had a nasty habit of killing any animal he crossed paths with. Anyway as soon as my mother opened the door to let the dog in  the dog literally knocked her over and went immediately into the bedroom under the bed. The door was still open  so I looked outside and (this happened very fast) I noticed how dead still and quiet everything was. I felt that little charge of fear race up my spine and I remember that the hairs were standing up on my arms and neck  and at that moment my mother came back ! and started to shut the door  when all of a sudden we both heard this SCREAM. It was not human  it was not any animal I had ever heard. It was almost like a cross between a woman's scream and a cougar. Since I knew that there weren't any cougars or women standing out on our dock  we both knew we were hearing something unimaginable. We then heard big sloshes of water  as if something great was passing through the lakefront. (Our House was only about 1/2 an acre up from the lake.) This whole episode probably only lasted about 5 minutes. We then noticed that the normal sounds of the swamp came back as if someone had turned the lights back on. We knew that whatever it was  continued down the lake. We heard from other families that lived along the lake that they had experienced the same thing.",Bigfoot
Report 28667: Resident hears possible early morning vocalizations near Westfield,Calls came from south west of Westwood Dr.,MA,Westfield   MA 3am Couldn't sleep and went outside to have a cigarette. Heard howls in the distance that I never heard before. I've worked as a wilderness counselor for the past 10 years and heard all sorts of animal noises in the night foxes  coyotes  owls etc.. This sound had a lack of clarity but power in its voice. I knew that it came from a long distance away. I remember listening to Bigfoot calls years back and on a hunch ran inside found the EXACT same howls on the net sounded like the Snohomish  WA 1978-79 calls. I woke up my friend who has been hunting western mass for 30 years and he said he never heard anything like it. He heard it and he said it gave him the chills. The howls trailed off as if he creature was moving. Incident lasted for about 10 minutes. I google mapped the area the sound came from and its a huge swath of wilderness that stretches into Vermont and south into Connecticut.,Bigfoot

I just hanging out by a swamp clearing a trail and had a weird feeling where something was watching me.

About thirty seconds later I heard another one and that one caught my attention but I didn't see it. It was bigger and it was in the middle of the swamp. So I dialed my buddy and as he picked up the phone  a rock about the size of a football  if not bigger was thrown about three quarters across the swamp and I saw this one hit the water.,Bigfoot

Adams  MA.,MA,"My wife and I started to make our descent from the summit of Mount Greylock during a morning hike.  Approximately half a mile on the Cheshire Harbor Trail  close to Rockwell Rd  my wife and I heard a clapping sound.  We stood in place for a few moments  listening to the sound.  The ""clapping"" was non-rhythmic  sometimes there was one or two  other times there were many ""claps"".  In between the ""claps"" there was sounds of something walking  breaking fallen branches as it moved.  The sounds were about a distance of 100 feet from our position on the trail  within a thicker patch of woods.  We listened for almost a full minute and then decided to continue on the trail  moving closer to the source of the sound.  When we reached the area where we believed the clapping sound to be coming from we listened again and heard nothing and had seen no movement.  Further down the trail I attempted figure out the sound.  I did some tree knocking and banged rocks together  but only when I clapped my hands did it most closely match the sound my wife and I had heard.  It was a sound that I have never heard before and it has sparked my interest into figuring out what animal made this noise.",Bigfoot
Report 25137: Memory told of a possible late night sighting while driving near Hurlock,near pine forest and creeks,MD,"This incident occurred on a surf trip to Ocean City Md. with my high school friend and surfing buddy but we had gone up rt. 404 into Delaware to cut down from Rehobeth beach. I'm not sure where EXACTLY but it was between a number of farms and on a road off of 404 which we considered a shortcut. The area was dense pine trees and I would guess it was late spring as there was no traffic at all and usually in summer there was even at the time we were travelling  between 3 and 4 AM. We were moving at about 60 to 70 MPH and looking out for deer and were very much awake. I saw a pair of eyes off in the woods some ways up  perhaps 100 meters when I noticed them and as we were closing rapidly I braked fairly heavily. My friend and I saw what I can only describe as an absolutely enormous hairy creature moving VERY fast from the passenger side of the road to the left side. I would estimate it to be at least 8 feet to the shoulder and hunched forward  almost on four legs but definitely NOT a quadruped. It was positively terrifying and we both looked at each other and said ""WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!?!"". I will never forget the size of the thing. Neither of us have any idea what it was but both of us were outdoorsmen and camped regularly and experienced in the woods. For many years afterward we have speculated what it was and I think I may have told three or four people about it but never was taken entirely seriously.",Bigfoot

Report 29330: Recollection of possible vocalizations and brush crashing while camping in the Lil-Aaron Straus Wilderness Area,We returned to the site the following year and found the cemetery. Our camp was about 100 yards away. I would need to look at the map again to verify the exact location.,MD,"Myself and 2 good friends were camping in the Lill Aaron Strauss Wilderness area of Green Ridge State Park in Allegheny County Maryland. We were all in our late teens but very experienced campers and very comfortable in the woods. On the 2nd night of our trip we made camp in a low area several miles off the trails near where our topographic map showed a Civil War cemetery was located  though we were unable to find the site. After dinner we sat around the fire as the darkness grew and we all began to feel a bit spooked  as if we were being watched  so we let the fire burn itself out and bedded down. Early the next morning I awoke to a loud wailing which I can only describe as a cross between a lion roar and a screech owl. The noise happened several times and it was very close. At the same time we heard something crashing through the vegetation nearby and what sounded like thick branches cracking and heavy thuds as if large logs or rocks were impacting the forest floor. My friend Bryan and I were sleeping in hammocks over which we had suspended rain ponchos. The ponchos were fastened to the hammocks so we would need to untie them in order to get out and we could not see out either. I whispered to Bryan ""what was that?"". He whispered back ""I don't know"". That was all we said. I was scared out of my mind and did not dare even move my head to try to see anything as I didn't want to draw attention to myself. I was able to look at my watch and determine it was just after 5am. At that moment I resigned myself to my fate  figuring that if something out there wanted me I would have no chance. I made my peace and waited  eventually drifting back off to sleep. Bryan did not sleep at all after the episode and our 3rd friend  Tom  somehow slept through the whole thing. We rose around 6am and broke camp. We looked around for signs of anything unusual but could find nothing.",Bigfoot
Report 10778: Vocals and thrown objects experienced by two friends exploring,Land is owned by the Monocacy Hunting Club.,MD,"My friend and I had been searching for a place called Dickerson quarry in Dickerson Md  and had just located it on a map. We had to park on some railroad tracks by the aquaduct and walk through some very dense sticker bushes and overgrowth to find the place. To describe the quarry  it is located in the middle of the woods. It is about 75 yards long and about 30 yards wide with very tall cliffs  about 50 to 80 feet tall in some places. However there are a few places where you can walk down to the waters edge. As we were approaching the quarry  we heard this very loud screeching sound coming from about 25 yards away in the overgrowth. It was very loud and it actually startled us when it first started. The only way to describe the sound would be to say it sounded like a pig getting slaughtered. We stopped walking and waited but it stopped  whatever it was. We continued walking and found the quarry  hearing the strange sound several more times  always coming from a different place. We made a survey and located a place to go down to the waters edge to sit and rest. As we made our way around the quarry we heard the screaming again. Actually coming from the area where we wanted to go! We were not too alarmed though  being curious and stupid. We made it to the waters edge and sat down and started to look around and check the place out. I had picked up a stick off the ground and got out my pocket knife and started to carve on the wood. Suddenly there was a very large splash in the water. It sounded like a person had just jumped in but when I looked up could see ripples in the water where something had gone in. Figuring it was a rock falling from the cliffs we began talking again. About 5 minutes elapsed and we heard another splash. This one bigger and it was very far away from the edge. I asked my freind ""Did you throw something in?"". He said no  he was looking at me. We looked around to see if anyone was there that we didnt see but there was no one anywhere. We sat for about 5 more minutes talking and then heard another big splash. Neither of us saw what made it but the disturbance in the water was so big we guessed it had to be something big! We started to think that someone was in the woods and didnt want us trespassing and was trying to scare us off. However as we started to really think  we became aware there was no way anyone could throw any rock that big  that far. So we made the choice to go ahead and leave. As we were climbing up and out of the quarry another splash came from very near where we had been sitting and also sounded very big. We reached the top and started to make our way to the car. We only walked about 20 feet when something came crashing through the tree branches and hit the ground near us very hard. It sounded like a 20 pound rock hitting the ground. At that point we both stopped walking and turned and really looked hard into the woods. Neither of us saw anything. As we stood there listening  I swear Ive never heard the woods more quite in my life.  We started to walk again and the objects being thrown at us started to get alot more accurate. I remember saying to my freind ""What the hell is going on?"" His response was to tell me GO!!! We took off running and reached our only real obsticle  a creek about 10 feet wide where we had to cross on a log. I went first and he was close behind. As we where halfway across the log something landed in the creek about 5 feet from me that had to be the size of a paint bucket. I didnt see if it was a rock or what but it was big. At that point I jumped for it and hit the ground running with my freind right on my tail  neither of us looking back. I have never really felt scared like that  but that day I had the thought that we might meet something that was beyond nature and not live to tell about it. Our journey into the woods took about 30 minutes due to the high growth of pricker bushes  Our journey out took about 3 minutes! We reached the car and the only after the adrenaline wore off did we realize we both were bleeding nicely from running top speed through summer overgrowth. At the time  I didnt know about the connection between the rocks being thrown at us and the screaming to bigfoot  but it sounds like a classic case. Ive only been back a few times since then and only in the winter where I can see for 100 yards!!",Bigfoot
Report 30634: Night hikers possibly stalked near Bee Tree Preserve,I don't want to include directions in this report.,MD,"In mid spring of this year  I was hiking through the woods with a friend in the middle of the night. Making our way up onto a trail  we stumbled upon a picnic table and decided to sit down and rest. We were startled to find the whole ground glowing green around us. Using my headlamp  we attempted to spot whatever was causing these little glowing green dots. At the time we had no clue what was causing this to happen  but we later realized that firefly larvae were lighting up the forest floor. Seeing the glows coming more intensely from a nearby hillside deeper in the woods  we decided to scan the the hillside with our headlamp. As soon as we shined the headlamp  we caught a pair or grapefruit sized bright green (with a slight hint of gold) eye reflections peering over the crest of the hill. We stood in shock  never removing the light from those eyes. ""Maybe its a deer "" she said. A few moments later the eyes raise up to be about 5 off the ground and rotate slightly more towards us. ""See "" I say  ""It is just a deer."" As soon as that last word leaves my mouth the eye reflections stand up another 4 feet to be standing at a towering 9 feet. It slowly occurred to be that I had never seen eye reflections of this color and that the closest thing might be a bear. Suddenly I hear a slight rustling behind me. Swinging the light around we caught the reflections of two more sets of eyes. They too were grapefruit sized and green  but were spookily sneaking up on us from behind. I get caught in a frenzy of shinning the light back and forth between all three sets of eyes until they just quietly disappear. we hurried out of the area  terrified  and made our way south to a different hiking area to take the whole situation in. Again we noticed firefly larvae  but when we began to approach the woods (which in fact are connected to the last area by water system) a bunch of creatures began running around in the woods  breaking branches and shaking bushes and trees. Later  upon watching one of your videos and discussing the experience with some knowledgable peers  I realized that I had experienced a sasquatch encounter.  Returning to the same spot some 2 or 3 months later with a few buddies  we were able to catch the same eye reflections for a very short period of time.",Bigfoot

Report 66224: Distinct wood knocks heard 18 miles NNE of Bangor,Heavily wooded wilderness miles off Route 2 into the old logging camps. [Large property near the end of Cedar Ridge Road],ME,"I was not in any way aware that these creatures existed in Maine  firstly. I am from Connecticut however I have spent years in desolate oilfields across the U.S. including places like West Texas  the upper Peninsula of Michigan  and the Everglades of Florida. I have a vast knowledge of wildlife as I have always taken an interest to it and spent years IN the forest. My point is  what I experienced this day has shaken me to the core as I know my encounter was nothing ""normal"". In the Northwoods of Maine in a town called Greenbush  (population 1 400) I purchased 80 acres of wilderness with virgin forest on the back half of the lot. (meaning not even loggers have been there  it's that desolate.) I had rented an excavator and for this entire day I had been cutting a road through swamp  hills and forests to a high hill I call Hope Hill on the virgin most desolate corner of my land where I want to build my cabin. I had made it halfway and in the swamp I realized I was out of fuel. I shut down the machine and get out. I step down onto to road and was admiring my work and just relishing in the whole idea of pioneering this new path. Suddenly about 50 yards into the tree line I hear a bang with a stick on to a tree. Like someone was hitting a wooden bat against a large tree trunk as the percussion was unmistakable... At first I thought ""Oh crap there is a moose"" because it is mating season for them and they are known to ram their antlers against trees to intimidate their foes. Suddenly  the sound happens again. Now I am certain this is no moose as no branches are breaking  there is movement  no grunts  nothing... Just this wooden thump just through the trees where I can't see. I begin walking further away because I'm obviously freaked out. Again  but now 2 knocks... I grab a large branch I had just ripped down with the machine and smacked it against a large tree trunk. Immediately I received a knock in response. I wait around 45 seconds.... I knock again  BANG it knocks right after me again... I knock again 5 seconds later  it responds again right back.... Now I am shaking because I know what I presume this creature to be. It's obviously strong because the bang was very loud. Intimidating... I knew there was a certainty I was interacting with Sasqauch. I went back to my trailer on my qaud which was parked about 200 feet down the trail. I FLEW home. I calm down  now I am questioning reality and am quite  scared I guess. This is my land  I'm only halfway through making the road  these are my thoughts  so I decide to ride back... I knock again. It responds. I take my phone out. Turn on record on video  I knock  it goes away... Almost as if it knew I was recording. Regardless it was incredibly perplexing. I got back on the quad and went back home knowing for sure what I just experienced was legitimate. I brought a feather bead string thing from a dream catcher and brought it out there as a gift. It's been 3 days. I haven't gone back to see if it's still there.",Bigfoot
Report 56798: Possible track way found in the snow in Vaughn Woods State Park east of Dover,Vaughn Woods State Park in South Berwick  Maine.,ME,I was hiking in the woods  doing occasional whoops and wood knocks to try to illicit a response. It felt so squatchy from the moment I got there  but I got no response to anything. I was about an hour into my trek and I see off the beaten path a series of footprints. The snow had stopped yesterday and I tell you these prints were FRESH. I am thinking I just missed that squatch by a matter of minutes or hours! SO CLOSE! Well  let me tell you what!! These things were 12'' long and the stride between steps was measured at 8 feet! The line of prints was straight  just like you see with other evidence of a bigfoot trail! It was INSANE. There were no other prints around  I followed these about a quarter mile into the depths of the woods and off the beaten path. The snow was up past my knees at some points but how could I stop following this epic trail! I could see some prints more clearly than others  I could see toe outlines and the heel in a few! I have pictures and videos to share with you. By the looks of the size of the prints and the distance in stride  this seems like an adult sasquatch  These things were huge!! The sun was setting and my phone was dying so to my dismay I had to turn around and get back to the path before dark  otherwise I would have followed those tracks until they lead me to whatever made them  and we know what made those beasts! This is the BEST day ever. My very first bigfoot evidence and experience and I couldn't be happier!!! There is literally NOTHING else this could be  it is an amazing and documented bigfoot footprint trail!,Bigfoot
Report 67335: Knocks heard near Spectacle Pond  27 miles east of Bangor,Spectacle Pond  West of Kingman Brook,ME,Background:  I have spent a large part of my life in the woods between Eddington where I grew up and Deblois where my Grandfather built a hunting / fishing camp in the 1920s – everywhere in between hunting  fishing  camping and hiking.  I have walked those woods since I was 4 years old and I’m now 61 – I know the deer  moose   bear and other wildlife of those woods.  I built my camp on Spectacle Pond in Osborn in 1988.  I have spent a lot of time in the years since exploring the woods and waters around the camp over the years and know the area between Route 179 and Route 193 better than most and within 10 miles of my camp  better than anyone.  Since 2008 when I retired from the U.S. Navy  I have spent one month every year at my camp – 2 weeks in May  fishing and 2 weeks in November  hunting.  I have spent many days and nights in the most remote areas of that part of Maine. On the evening of November 12th  2020  my wife and I had returned to our camp after an afternoon deer hunt  it was dark by the time we got back to camp and settled in for a routine evening with getting the camp warmed up  supper  a couple hands of cribbage and talking – we had been in camp for 10 days.  At around 8:30 my wife decided to go to bed as we planned to hunt the morning.  I picked up my book and was reading until 10:30.  The only light within a half mile of my camp was the single gas light in the front room of the camp which I was using to read – the nearest people were 0.5 mile away in their camp back toward Route 9.  I decided to call it a night at 10:30 and wanted to relieve myself before I went to bed so I went outside across the porch  down the front steps and walked approximately 15 feet to the back outside corner of the camp.  Within seconds of standing in that spot there was two very loud “THWACK” sounds just inside the woodline which is 15 yards across the back yard.  It took me by surprise as I’ve never heard that sound before completely by myself in the woods.  It sounded identical to someone taking a large stick of firewood and hitting a tree in full swing.  I could easily replicate that noise as in knocking snow/ice off firewood against a tree  but with force.  I did not have a flashlight with me as the diffused light from the gas light inside the camp gave me enough point of reference to get back inside so I didn’t think to bring one with me.  I stood there perplexed as to what I had just heard and trying to make sense of it  when it happened again…”THWACK” but this time a little farther away – maybe 25-30 yards  but still quite loud.  This repeated itself 10 or 11 times over a period of maybe 2 to 3 minutes  each time a little more distant than before.  I remained standing there as I was still trying to figure out what it was “THWACKing” these trees.  After the hitting of trees dissipated  I returned to the camp and locked the door – I didn’t (and still don’t) know what it was but I knew it wasn’t a person  moose  deer or bear!  Of note  there was absolutely no light as in a flashlight from a person.  Additionally  those woods are extremely thick with dead spruce and fir – lots of blowdowns yet there was absolutely no noise – no snapping branches  breaking twigs. Nothing – Silence.  I can tell you first hand that nobody could walk down through there in broad daylight  much less at night without a flashlight without snapping branches and making a lot of noise. I spent an additional hour in the camp that night reflecting on what I had heard and trying to attribute it to something that made sense – there was none in all of my experience.  I went to bed and when we got up Friday morning  we decided to hang out at camp to get a start on packing and cleaning as we were closing up camp and leaving on Saturday.  I walked into the woods during daylight where I heard the “THWACK” noises the night before but found nothing where I expected to see some type of sign.  Needless to say  I didn’t tell my wife about those events until Saturday morning as we were getting ready to leave. I still have no idea what it was and it was so dark  I didn’t see anything but I can tell you that I’ve never heard or experienced anything like that in the many years I’ve spent in those woods and the 30+ years I’ve owned that camp.,Bigfoot
Report 3525: Snowmobiler finds large barefoot tracks in upper peninsula of Michigan,To the best of my knowledge  the incident occured in sec. 24 (on the north side of the Tahquamenon River) T46N  R9W Mcmillan Twsp. Luce Co. Mi.,MI,While sno-mobiling in a remote area of the county in which I live  I noticed somewhat ahead of me something had walked and left this trail of foot-prints or tracks in the snow. I right away thought this is unusual as people just do not venture into this marshy area. Now this is the 3rd week of Feb.  and that winter we had had a heavy fall of snow  and the depth of the snow in that area was around 30 inches. I was able to sno-mobile as the snow had a very hard crust on the surface solid enough to support the weight of the sno-machine without breaking through. So I drove right up on the trail made by something and I stopped and looked down at them. Then I realized these were not black-bear tracks of one coming out of hibernation early  or some person on snow-shoes  or any other familiar thing. These were human bare-foot tracks. The impression left in the snow by whatever walked through there was perfect. The heel mark  the toes  the way the feet taper from wide in the front to narrow by the heel. And thats when the hair on the back of my neck stood on end. A bare-foot giant had walked through there. I saw those prints  and a real fear came over me. And at that time  I had never heard of bigfoot. I had heard of Yeti  in the Himalayas  and Sasquatch in the Pacific north west  but never Bigfoot. I got out of there in a hurry.,Bigfoot

The sound of the foot steps were very heavy and we could hear branches breaking as it moved around.  My partner and I were a few hundred yards apart and the noise came from a thick cover between our spots.  We both heard it as my partner called me on the two way asking if I could hear it too.  I don't know that it was a bigfoot however it was scarry enough for me to remove the safety from my gun and actually swing in the direction it came from knowing my partner was in that direction as well.

Report 25323: A family is chased by a sasquatch near Wadena.,4-5 miles north of wadena and 1 mile west of hwy 71.,MN,"Younger Brother: In 1992-93 we went to visit family friends.  And when playing outside us kids built a tent-like fort over the clothesline.  With sheets and clothespins.  Then later when were called in for dinner we went in and ate.  Then watched a movie.  And as now it was late we decided to leave on wishing us farewell the owner of the house saw the fort with her sheets still up and said ""no one is going anywhere until those sheets are in the house"". So me being little I got out of the work and got to sit in the van with my mom. Who turned on the head lights so they did not have to dismantle the fort in the dark.  As we are watching this my mom says ""hey do you see that shadow over there by the tree?""  and I tried to look but could not make it out.  so she took a flash light and shined it in the vicinty but not directly on it hoping not to spook whatever it was that was only 20-30 feet from the kids and the clothesline.  she asked me again if i couls see that thing just standing there watching the kids take down the tent-fort. when i said no she called over my big brother who instantly saw what she was talking about. And in his excitement he grabbed the flash light ran towards it. and i will let him take it from here. Older Brother: I approached the clothes line and held the light on the trees just beyond us and never did shine the light on this shadow figure due to i was afraid too. But what i remember from then was seeing the out line of a dark colored figure. It was adifferent shade  than the tree bark. it was near 6 in a half feet tall or maybe 7 feet. I was about 5'9"" at the time and i felt very short upon seeing this shadow next to the tree about 20 feet from me and my sister and her friend. We all saw this outline of a tall man near that tree when i told the girls that there was something by that tree watching us. It never moved from its position by the tree it stood up right and just seemed to watch. We hurried quickly and gathered the sheets off the line and i threw them in a bag and gave them to the friend as i was scared and so was my sister. We ran to the van and she got in first and i followed. My seat in this van was not a normal seating position. My folks had installed another van seat in the van that faced out the back window. This was the seat i took and sat in this night. Mom backed down the drive way. As she turned on the road the head lights passed over the spot where the figure had stood and everyone but me at this time say they saw the what looked like a upper body shape or a set of shoulders that where large. Mom started to drive forward towards Wadena and as we pulled away from this sighting of this shadow and figure. I watched in terror as i saw it running down the tree line towards the road we were on heading home. I told mom to drive faster and to this day she claims she was doing about 30 miles an hour on this dirt road. I watched this thing take and turn at the ditch and run real fast and real close to our van it had kept up for the first half a mile. Before it must have given up on following us anymore. It never ran on the road it stayed in the ditch and was fast. It didnt pump its arms when it ran like a sprinter does. The arms of this beast swung long and almost like with ease right in stride with its long stride as it kept up very well with the van. I know it didnt run like a mile or anything but it was almost a half mile that it did and never lost speed or footing in its steps as it chased us. Younger Brother: I would like to add someting now to my brothers discription. First off will never forget the feeling of not knowing what was going on when he hurried and took down the fort quickly.  I could tell he was scared and remember very clealy as he ripped the sheets off the line the clothespins popping up in the air madly.  I knew something was wrong   I was eight or so and this was my big brother.  Nothing scared him.  He was like the strongest person knew. And when my brother said it was chasing us his seat faced the back but I turned over the second seat and you could see it plainly in the red light provided by the tail lights.  There was a shadow on two legs not more than ten feet from us running in the ditch after the van.  It was very fast and especially for its size.",Bigfoot

I caught this movement from my peripheral vision from my left (so it was on the other side of 169) where there was a car pulled over on the opposite side apparently watching what I was seeing.  Because I was headed to Virginia and there were trees that popped up in the median as I was driving  I only observed this ""something"" for about 3 seconds or so.  It did have a peculiar way that it's arms moved when I saw it walking  and it had a cone-shaped head. After that  the wooded area in the median obscured my vision  but if I would have found a place to make a quick u-turn  I would have turned around to go back and investigate.  I sort of talked my self out of believing what I saw because this ""something"" was not the normal brownish/red color typified of a bigfoot sighting.  Perhaps it was one of those new-fangled netting out-fits hunters wear.  All I know is I saw something.",Bigfoot

It is right on the lake.,MN,We were camping  North of Orr MN at Lake Jeanette. Around four in the morning I heard heavy large foot steps coming toward our tent. It was definately on two feet I was wide awake and have no doubt about that. I yelled  Who's there? and it threw a rock at our tent  then walked very fast away. once again with huge heavy foot steps. I tried to recreate the sound of the steps in the morning but was unable to sound that loud. Still wondering what it was.,Bigfoot
Report 62297: Two young campers get stalked at night  then a Sasquatch sighting the next morning near John J. Audubon Historic Trail in Mark Twain National Forest,At the time it was called John J. Audibon Historical Trail. It was on a county road in a forest.,MO,While laying down and preparing to go to sleep we heard foot prints coming our way from within the woods. Not knowing what it was I grabbed a handful of chat from the ground and threw it in the direction of the steps. The creature took a number of steps back into the woods. Then it stopped and started coming back towards us. It was a two legged creature. You could tell it was walking on two legs. At that point we both got up and ran to the car. We then drove back and forth returning to gather what we could off of the ground and we left the area. At this point we drove back to the highway and to a roadside park where we spent the rest of the night in the car. The next morning we went back  restarted our fire from the night before  I prepared breakfast  eggs and bacon. After cleaning up the dishes we began walking the trail [ Mark Twain National Forest ]. Approximately 1 mile in we stopped at a spring I knew about to get a drink and fill our canteens and continue down the trail which followed a creek. After walking another mile or so I heard a noise coming from our right  I looked to my right and then I saw it. Up the wooded hill I saw a reddish long haired man type of creature  approximately 7-8 foot tall running through the woods. I was able to see it for around 5 steps before it cleared the top of the hill and disappeared. At this point I turned to the girl I was with and asked her if she saw it. She said no but at this point I was ready to go and she didn't argue with me and we walked back down the trail to her car and we left. I got no argument from her. She was with me the night before when we heard it outside our camp. I was dating another girl who I eventually married  the girl I was with was not her. I was a JR in high school at the time.,Bigfoot
Report 10927: Bow hunter observes animal lying down in the Creve Coeur bottoms.,This area was behind Chesterfield Golf  Club  and bordered up river by St. Louis County Water Works. This area is now fenced off and posted by Missouri Department of Conservation.,MO,"While Bow-hunting in Creve Coeur bottoms  I had been in my stand all day and had no luck. So I got down right before dusk and proceded to stalk along side a trail leading to the river. I had come to a point were the trail turns and runs parelell to the river.When I started around the turn something moved in the corner of my eye off to my right. My first thought was that I was going to scare up a deer  So I drew my Bow and tried to take aim on the area of movement  But what I saw was not a deer. At first  I thought it was a man in camo laying on the ground  That freaked me out  so I let off my Bow. However  I was trying to make out this ""person"" laying on the ground  on thier belly  When it raised up on it's right arm  turned the upper half of it's body  And looked at me. This was no person. It was to dark to see any features  But I could see two legs stretched out behind it  Two arms in front  A large torso  And a head. It seemed to be covered in greyish-brown from head to toe. No visible gear  Which struck me as odd  So I continued to try and figure out what this was. I stared at it  And it at me  When I felt the need to LEAVE. I did not feel threatened  Just that I had to go. As I began to leave and head back toward the levee  I kept thinking about turning back because I could not believe what had happened  But something made me go out of the woods. I have grown up in woods all my life  Have hunted in south-central and eastern  Missouri  And grew up only a few miles from here  But never before have I seen Something I could not explain. If this thing had stood up  It would easy have been a foot or more taller than Me.",Bigfoot

Report 12470: Fisherman has daytime sighting west of Mt. Vernon,From Mt. Vernon go west on SR V highway past Baptist Hill Assembly to the first bridge over Spring River.,MO,"When I saw it I was fishing on Spring River on SR V Highway due west of Mt. Vernon past Baptist Hill Assembly. It was in July 1997 I had been fishing near the bridge over Spring River and decided to move downstream a bit. As I came around a large group of oak trees I saw a figure walking from the stream towards the woods. At first I thought it was a hunter but realized it was too large to be a man 7-8 foot tall at least and probably over 600 pound ( I'm 6' 3"" and it was taller than me). It had long reddish brown hair kind of matted or curly looking. I was approximately 100 yards from it. I don't know if it saw me or not but it didn't seem to be in any rush to get into the woods. I watched it for at least five minutes before I couldn't see it anymore. I thought about trying to follow it but since I was alone I thought better of it  but I did go back the next day in the afternoon to see if I could find any footprints but didn't find anything that I could say definately belonged to the thing I saw.",Bigfoot
Report 26694: Possible nighttime encounter while camping near Potosi,It was near Bell Mountain  I didn't drive to the area so I wasn't really paying attention to the area.  I think we entered the trail just off what I thought was Country Road 32 if I saw the sign correctly.,MO,Went for a weekend hiking and camping trip with 4 family members.  We hiked about a mile and a half down an established trail before making a turn into the brush to find our camping spot just after sunset on the first night.  we probably hiked about 400 yards into the brush before setting up camp and turning in for the night as it began to rain.  I was woken up about 4:30am by a very strong odor that smelled just like a skunk  so much so that I assumed a skunk had made it into our camp and I zipped up the shell on my sleeping bag to avoid being sprayed.  The odor went away so I relaxed a bit more and tried to get back to sleep when I smelled it again only this time I had an overwhelming feeling I was being watched from directly behind me.  I rolled over to look and was able to make out a sillouette of a very broad shouldered shadow and head between two trees about 7 yards from where I was laying.  I immediately turned around and waited for daybreak  still unsure if I had seen anything or just imagined it I sat waiting and listening for anything aggressive in nature and it didn't happen so I chaulked it up to an overactive imagination but was still uneasy about staying in this location.  I said nothing to my family but I was determined to not let the camp fire die out on the second night.  The second night came and it rained again  we could hear the sound of what I would describe as a very loud owl.  We turned in for the night and all my family fast asleep let the fire get to the verge of dying  easily helped by the falling rain.  Sounds were all around the campsite but not really unexpected in a dry rotting forrest during some steady rains.  I got up to tend the fire and as the firelight grew it seemed the forrest sounds intensified  again probably just nerves.  I'm not an avid outdoorsman but I love the minor amount of time I do get to spend in the wilds.  It was about 3:30am at this time and one of my family members woke up and helped me with the fire  sensing my uneasyness he suggested I use his hammock to get some rest and he would watch the fire.  I got a couple hours sleep and woke up around 5:30am still before daybreak and my family member proceeded to tell me that about 15 minutes prior he heard a very loud crash in the forest and then another less intense crash directly behind the hammock where I was then sleeping.  It had alarmed him enough that he had his handgun out and ready but he said he didn't see anything and I still didn't say a word about what I thought I may have seen the night prior.  I actually did not tell anyone until we were on our way home and I told my brother about what I thought I saw  mostly out of fear of ridicule.  It wasn't until we got home and I started doing some research that I became more convinced of what I think I saw on the first night and what I smelled.  During our time at this campsite the rain stopped during the day and we were able to hike around the area probably covering almost 2 miles and one of things that struck us was the complete lack of any wildlife.  We saw a woodpecker and heard the sounds of birds chirping on the first morning  but that was it  nothing not a single rabbit  squirrel  dear  bird or anything other than that woodpecker and a few fish in a nearby creek were seen in the area.  We did come across some animal droppings that looked almost like rabbit droppings only smoother.  We only stayed two nights even though we had planned on 4 nights total  fearing more rain we left early.,Bigfoot
Report 1339: Creature seen by witnesses,,MS,When I was a child  I heard my grandfather  a man who quit school at sixteen  tell stories about something that lived in the Burns Rebrake (a swampy area owned by a Mr. Homer Burns). The stories he told went back as far as WWI and included among others  my grandfather and my father. They never got a good look at the thing(my father always attributed it to bootleggers)but my grandfather said whatever it was  it drove lumbermen out of the woods and beat panther hounds so bad that they didn't come home for days. When I was little  I listened to the old people describe the thing and it didn't register in my mind until I got older that it sounded an awful lot like a sasquatch. I've heard there's something in Lousiana  and with all the primitive waterways that cross that two states  I wouldn't be surprised if the two aren't connected. The Burns Booger as they called it has been absent from the area since the sixties when the lumber companies went high tech. This is the same time the last panther was heard in Attala County. My great grandfather and a man were logging in the area after WWI and something frightened them so bad that they quit logging and refused to go back in there. My grandfather and father along with some coon hunters saw something standing by a dieing fire that they had built. They said it looked like a man but then it didn't. (My memory is hazy) on the exact descriptions. My father's coon hounds were known to hunt panther  but something tangled into them one night setting the dogs to howling in pain and terror. Before my father or grandfather could get to them  it was over. The dogs didn't come up for days. All the old people I heard the stories from saidthere was something in those woods  but the old people are all gone now and no one's heard from the Burns Booger in years. (I've not heard anymore stories of recent origin).,Bigfoot
Report 1342: Child sees a large  dark face staring at him from the bushes.,Meridian  Mississippi  Lauderdale County.  By the NAVY base  In the woods behind Military housing.,MS,"When I was 8 or 9 years old  my sister  some friends and I were swimming in a small water hole(more like a wide spot in a creek)  behind the military housing.  Probably about 400 yds. into the woods.  I wasn't swimming I was sitting down at the side of the water hole with my feet in the water but kind of drawn up beside me and my sister was sitting between my legs in the water.  We were all just playing around being pretty loud and I don't know if I heard something  caught some movement out of the corner of my eye or what  but my attention was drawn to a large bush on the other side of the ""swimming hole"". I sat there staring at this bush for a good 30 or 40 seconds maybe a full minute  before I realized what it was I was seeing.  There was a face looking at me from behind (between) some branches.  The face was very big  flat  dark brown almost black  eyes were black. I thought at the time that the eyes were looking at me with curiosity or amusement.  It didn't look evil  menacing or well you know. I don't remember a mouth or nose.  I remember the hands being huge  gigantic  the size of baseball mitts.  It seemed like I was looking at it for minutes or longer  but couldn't have been that long  and all of a sudden I was just terrified.  I picked up my sister and screaming ran out of there and everybody just followed me out. I was the only one who saw it  my friends wanted to know why I was so scared.  I told them it was Old Man Walker  (A hermit who supposedly lived way back in the woods  and would shoot at you if he saw you)  and they were o.k. with that.  I didn't want to believe what I saw but it defiantly was not an old man. I found it very comforting to know I was not the only one to have seen something so frightening. Thinking about my encounter I was in no way threatened and I don't know why I was so frightened  but to this day I still wake up with night mares. Thank you.",Bigfoot
Report 1338: Several incidents in the East Fork Community,All encounters occured in Amite County  Mississippi  in a wooded area about one mile south of Hwy. 23. This area  known as East Fork Community is about 15 miles west of McCombe  MS,MS,"Unfourtunately  I have no video or audio  only personnel observation. The first encounter did not involve a sighting. As a young boy  I was out on the front porch with my mother  father  uncle  and grandfather. At around 9:00 pm  we all heard a sound that was not unlike a shrill human scream. Untill that night  I did not know what it meant to have your hair stand on end. A somewhat large dog that we had outside barked  cried  and ran away in apparrent terror. The only thing we found the next day was a single partial footprint. The next encounter happened when my cousin and I were in the woods fishing at a pond on our grandfathers property. We first noted a very strong odor that we took to be a skunk. We then heard a sound like a scream  a few grunts  then nothing. Before the next encounter  there were some unusual incidents that deserve mentioning. First was the finding of dead livestock  mainly pigs. They almost always had been found with their liver and heart removed. I never saw this myself  only heard the stories. I did see on at least two ocassions all of the fruit eaten off of trees on the property. In both cases  all of the fruit was removed from the trees  and the pits on the ground around the tree. We laughed about the belly ache something would have from eating an entire tree of green pears. Later  as a teenager  I was alone in the woods. I had the distinct feeling I was being watched. I crossed a barbwire fence near the road  crossed the road and entered the woods there. When I returned to the road a short time later  20-30 minutes  I saw that the fence I had earlier crossed  had been partially knocked down. Upon approaching the damaged fence  I noticed several ""large"" footprints. They appeared human in every respect except for their size. Even then  I wore a size 12D boot  the prints were at least two to three inches longer and maybe two inches wider than my boot. The tracks led first to the road  then back into the woods. Maybe a year later  a friend and I were in the woods. He was from New Orleans  LA  and knew nothing of the past encounters. While near a creek bottom  he suddenly froze and ask me what was watching us. I stood near him and saw what I first thought was a bear about 25 yards away. It was in a squating position. It then stood upright. It was  I'm sure  seven to eight feet tall. The creature was covered with very dark brown hair over it's entire body  with the exception of it's face. It stood upright like a man  not stooped like a bear. As we departed the area  we watched it follow us. The creature had a long stride and it's arms swung as it walked. It followed us to the edge of the wood line. The only sounds it made were whistling noises. My next and last encounter did not occur until I was in the army. A co-worker and I went to the old house to do some shooting. We arrived late that night. As we sat outside talking  we saw a large man shaped creature walk accross the road about 125 yards away. It walked into the woods and disappeared. It did not seem to notice us.",Bigfoot
Report 2376: Young couple encounter a rancid smell,South of town  near the gulf about half mile from the ocean.,MS,This is the second report I have submitted. The first was of screams in Arizona where I am living now. This one took place in Jackson County Mississippi in 1973. My father was living in Ocean Springs and working for Littons Ship Systems in Pascagoula. I had joined him there from Arizona when I decided to try my hand at pipefitting instead of Mining. I had bought an acre of land and put a trailer house on it before I had my wife join me. We were on the south side of town in an area of bayous. One night we were at my Dads place playing dominoes when we ran out of diapers for my baby daughter. It was only about a half mile from Dads to my house  so the wife and I jumped in the pick-up and went to the house for more diapers. I had two Red Bone hounds penned in the back of the house and when we got there they were barking as if they had something treed. I was curious as to what they were barking at  as they seldom barked while penned. When I got out of the truck  I noticed a rancid smell coming from the back of the house. I ask my wife what she had given the hounds and she said nothing that smelled that bad. I left the truck running and we went into the house and gathered the new diapers then back to the truck and left. We didn't give it anymore thought that night. I didn't pay much attention when we got back home later  but didn't remember smelling anything then. The next night we were back at my Dads playing dominoes again  and listening to the news from the TV. We heard a report from Pas Christian that a woman had called the police and reported a hairy ape looking man outside her backyard  looking in her kitchen window. She said it was looking over her back fence  which was six foot tall  and she could see it's head and shoulders above the fence. Also  the kicker was that it was accompanied by a rancid smell like rotting meat. The same smell I encountered around my house the night before. Wow  was that weird. I looked around the next morning  but couldn't find any tracks or anything around the house. And there was no smell of rotting meat to be detected. I think we had a close encounter.,Bigfoot
Report 1344: while playing tag with several other children witness saw a white hairy creature.,,MS,"Subject: White Bigfoot I just read the Louisiana encounter on your site and thought it great that someone else had seen a white bigfoot. I have not told anyone outside of friends about my experience  although there were plenty of others around at the time. This encounter happened  Ohhh bout 30 years ago in Columbus  MS. I and several of the neighborhood kids were out playing in my front yard. I was the oldest  so the rest of the dozen or so kids were 4th grade and earlier in school. All of us were playing ""Tag"" and to make things level-out for the younger kids  we all were turning round and round to get dizzy so the youngers could have a fighting chance of  catching us. All of a sudden  my youngest brother ran through the group yelling ""Booger-Bear!!"" He looked TOTALLY scared to death. I thought he was joking  but then my next brother did the same while pointing toward the unoccupied side of out duplex apartment house. Soon  I looked around to find that I was the only one left in my front yard  the rest of the kids had run to where the parents where outside chatting next door. All of them were holding onto his/her parent(s). Well  I looked down the street and saw nothing unusual. Looked again  both ways  same result. As I was turning back toward them  my eye caught a movement beside my duplex. Something was standing at the corner  hugging it as though to peek around a corner. It appeared to be slightly hunched over and yet the top of it's head was at the top of the window. The top of that window was at about the 7ft plus level. Could have been higher. One day I might get a chance to measure it cause the house is still there today  although the neighborhood is not where I would care to be at anytime nowdays. Anyway  I stood there looking  trying to figure out what this white hairy thing was. Earlier in the year  maybe a couple of months (been a long time ago)  there was a report of a white gorilla that had escaped from a circus. Thing is  kids know when a circus is around in those days  and I had never heard of one being anywhere near. It was just standing there  slightly moving kind of side to side. Since it was at dusk  and I couldn't really tell what this was that I was looking at  I slowly backed over to the grown-ups area. Eventually  the thing was hidden from my view by the house. I eventually worked up enough courage to make a wide arc toward where I saw it to see if it was still there. Nope  it was gone. I had a terrible time sleeping that night. Didn't want to be anywhere near a window even though we had no AC and it was warm weather. Next morning  I went to the area just to see if I could find anything. Nothing. I was never late for supper again. Never stayed out after dark. etc...The experience is real  though I have questioned my brothers about it and they remember nothing. Perhaps it was the grownups playing a joke?  They of course deny any knowledge. This is my only ""bigfoot"" story  though I have a couple of others that may spark some interest  one of which defies any rational explanation.",Bigfoot

It literally sent a chill down my spine and all I could think of to say was  ""You saw that too...."" . She simply said  ""yes"". I don't know what it was  but i know what it wasn't. It definitely wasn't a bear  goat  sheep  deer  elk  lion  dog  or any other wildlife that lives around here. It was white  standing erect  in excess of 6' tall and appeared to be just watching traffic on the highway (hard to say really  because the duration of this sighting was only a few seconds and it was dark) I find it hard to believe that someone was out there late at night in freezing weather standing in the snow in the middle of nowhere in a gorilla suit (especially a white gorilla suit!) so I've ruled that out as well.",Bigfoot

Report 1454: Three backpackers see a large  massive upright animal running on two legs through the brush in Gallatin Nat'l Forest,U.S.A. Gallatin National Forest  Gallatin County  Montana. ~10 miles east of US 191 ~30 miles south of Bozeman. Incident occurred in the Portal Creek area.,MT,"Two friends and I were backpacking in the summer of 93'. We were going to hike the Gallatin divide that summer  one weekend at a time. We started south of Bozeman and planned to finish in Yellowstone latter that summer. This was our third weekend and it being a Sunday we were hiking out to our car which was parked at the Portal Creek access. It was getting late in the day and it looked like some weather was rolling in. We were coming down the west side of windy pass so we decided to double time it so we weren't exposed in the weather. We didn't make it to the tree line before the storm hit us. The wind was howling and a nasty mix of rain/hail came down on us. When we were well enough below tree line we decided to sit out the storm by this rock out cropping. Wind whipping through the hills  especially in a rocky area like this  has a very distinct sound. It seemed like there was something else in that in that howl. Something that didn't quite sound like it was part of the wind. No one commented on it but I could tell by how Dan and Kevin were looking around that they heard it too. After about 45 minutes the wind died a bit and only a slight drizzle was falling. We started hiking back down  the clouds were clearing and it looked like we were gonna get a good view of sun setting over the Spanish peaks. We were coming through this clearing that had been cut maybe ten years ago. The sun was almost out of sight when we heard some thrashing across the clearing. It could have been almost anything but since we were in bear country Kevin took out his .357; not enough to stop a determined grizzly  but it was better than nothing. We proceeded slowly across the clearing. It was maybe a hundred yards towards to older tree line  with a lot of scrub and young pines in between. I was looking up for circling carrion when I heard this howl. It sounded like what I had heard earlier but now the wind wasn't behind it. It sent a chill up my spine. Dan  who was behind me yelled something to the effect of ""holy [#*$%]"" and pointed off to our right. Something massive and dark and clearly running on two legs ran through the brush about sixty yards away and disappeared into the forest. I don't think any of us moved or spoke for about five minutes until we heard the howl (yell?) again (this time pretty far off and in the opposite direction than we were heading) We got out of there in a hurry. We didn't tell too many people about this when we got back to town. We did return back to Portal Creek access the next weekend to start our hike again and I've been back to that area several times since hunting or just out of curiosity and I've never heard or seen anything unusual.",Bigfoot

These tracks were seen within a 2 mile radius in the northern mountains of North Carolina in a town called Glendale Springs  off the Blue Ridge Parkway. They were observed by several individuals including park rangers. Photos were taken by a resident of the town. These tracks seemed to cross over a split rail fence in one stride. The park rangers tried to explain them as rabbits or small animals jumping up out of the snow and back in again. These tracks were all around the home that I was living in at the time and I know I saw tracks of something that would have scared the life out of me had I seen it in person. I think that this creature was probably searching for food in the deepest snow in these mountains in several years.,Bigfoot

On Old School Road off Hwy 138,NC,While driving down the road about 10:30 pm I saw something standing on the left side of the road where the road curves to the right.  I threw my headlights on bright and turned the wheel to the left and drove streight to it. I was sideways in  the road. As I neared it I stopped and I had a clear view of it.  It was so tall that I had to lean closer to the steering wheel to look up into its face.  I could see him (clearly a male) from just above his knees to the top of his head.  I looked streight into his eyes.  He seemed to be comunicating with me though his eyes.  He let me get a good look at him and then he gave a nod and I knew I was to go. He was at least 7ft tall or more with silver and black hair some of it at least 4 to 5 inches long and dark outdoors type skin (where it was exposed. His eyes resembled that of a dogs and were the color of a alaskain husky and wide flat nose and a wide thin mouth like a mans. He never opend his mouth. Just stood there and looked at me and blinked some and make jesters with his head and eyes. When he knodded at me I knew it was time to leave so I turned the steering wheel very slowly ( I felt dazed) and drove on down the road.  I estimated the time I set there about 15 to 20 mnutes.  I went home about 1/4 miles up the road.Then I trembled  was so excited I could hardly walk.  I never was afraid.,Bigfoot

Report 1149: Late Afternoon sighting by motorist near Blue Springs,Southbound on highway 77  near Blue Springs  Nebraska ,NE,While traveling southbound on highway 77  near Blue Springs  Nebraska  I encountered a very large bi-pedal creature. As I came around a gentle left curve in the road  this creature stepped up out of the ditch on my side and with one stride was upon the road bed and with two more strides was across and going down into the ditch on the other side  a car coming the other way also saw this and we both slowed to a crawl as we came to the spot  I asked if they saw something and they responded they had also seen it. I was most impressed with the girth of the creatures legs  and torso  it was massive and about 7-8 feet in height  I would estimate the weight to be 6-700 pounds  the body was covered in medium length blackish brown hair  and the face appeared to be less hairy  I was not close enough to see any facial features  the arms swung normally and were longer than a mans proportionately. The quick stride and the movement was what impressed me the most along with the sheer mass. I'm familiar with the bigfoot lore having lived in California  but I never thought I would see one  especially in Nebraska. There was a creek just south of where the creature entered the road way  it seems it could have gone under the bridge if it wanted and remained unseen  it did not appear alarmed  just quick. This incident occurred in the Fall of 1974 I believe. I'm fifty and been an outdoorsman all my life. Good luck  hope you catch one  then maybe they will be protected  just don't kill one  might be the last one. the incident made a believer of me regardless what people say  I've seen one.,Bigfoot

Report 7809: Teen has nighttime sighting near Fontenelle Forest,Georgia Ave. and Tulip Ln. run East-West  My house was approximately 1/3 of a mile from Bellevue Blvd.  which ran along the heavily forested area of Fontenelle Forest.,NE,The following occured in 1975 when I was 14 years old.  My family lived in Bellevue  Nebraska (near Offutt Air Force Base) where my father had recently retired from the U.S. Air Force after 24 years of active duty.  I now live in Florida. Actually  this incident was a series of three encounters over a three-day period.  A bit of background seems necessary.  My girlfriend lived on the next block.  Our houses were separated by a field with a stand of trees on the north side of the field; the stand of trees was approximately 20 feet wide at that time and ran East-West.  The stand of trees ran to the East to Bellevue Blvd.  On the East side of Bellevue Blvd. was a heavely forested area that was either a part of  or bordered  Fontenelle Forest.  I would go over to my girlfriend's  house and visit until it was time for me to go back home (my curfew was 10:00 pm during the summer). The first incident occurred as I was crossing the field on my way home around 10:00 p.m.  I was walking in a NW direction with the thick stand of trees to my right.  I heard heavy foot-falls and occasional snapping of branchs within the stand of trees.  Whatever it was within the trees was paralleling me.  When I stopped  it stopped.  When I began walking again  it began walking.  It was very dark in the field and I could not see anything.  After several stops and starts  I became somewhat frightened and ran the rest of the way across the field  climbed over the 4-foot chainlink fence that surrounded our backyard  and ran up our backyard (it was basically a hill) and into the house. The second incident happened the very next night.  This occurrence happened exactly the same way as the first incident. The final incident happened on the third night.  As I crossed the field I again heard the heavy foot-falls and snapping of small branches within the stand of trees.  However  this time I was not being paralled; the thing was heading in a SW direction which placed it on an intercept course to my NW direction of travel.  I could hear it getting closer  but could not see anything because of the extreme darkness.  Near the point of interception  I began to smell a foul odor.  The odor was very stong and almost made me gag.  By now the foot-falls were very near.  I could feel the thing cross in front of me very close  but could not see anything.  The foot-falls were now on my left.  At this point I became extremely scared and began running across the field.  I'm not sure  but I suspect I cleared our 4-foot fence without even touching it. About half-way up the hill (our backyard) I stopped.  I can't explain why I did this  but I simply felt compelled to do so.  I turned around and saw what had crossed my path.  The backyard and a portion of the field was nicely illuminated by a flood-light my father had put on the back of the house. Standing at the edge of the field next to a clothes-line pole  was a creature on two legs.  It was covered in dark brown hair.  I estimate the height at 7 feet.  This is based on the fact that the clothes-line pole was 6 feet in height and the creature's head was a good foot above the top of the pole.  I was approximately 40-50 feet from it  but could not make out any facial features.  I recall that there was eye-shine  but I can't recall the color  possibly reddish.  The thing was extremely thick across the chest.  The arms hung almost to the knees.  This thing was very muscular.  We stood there staring at each other for approximately 20 seconds before I turned and ran into my house (I chickened out before it did). There is no question in mind that what I saw was a bigfoot.,Bigfoot
Report 22577: Three witnesses encounter a large creature while walking down a gravel road outside South Sioux City,Outside of South Sioux City NE on Golf road about 50 yards past Elgin ave.,NE,In september 1998  me and my brother-in-law and his girlfriend (which wish to remain anonimous) were walkin down the gravel road that I lived on. It was about 2:00am  we were about 1 mile away from my house  and we smelled this horrible smell  almost like the smell of something dead but stronger. We looked around  but couldnt see anything considering how dark it was. We walked a little bit farther and decided to turn around and go home. As we came across the spot that smelled so bad  we noticed that there was no smell anymore  so we decided to look around a little more. On both sides of the road were ditches that were about 8 to 10 feet deep. We walked over to the side of the road where we originally smelled that bad smell  as we got to the edge of the road a creature that looked to be about 7-8feet tall suddenly stood up  it was very dark that night but the creature looked to be the size of a grizzly bear  but there are no bears in the area I live in. Needless to say it scared the hell out of us and my brother-in-laws girlfriend screamed and the creature took off running as did we. As we were running back home we saw three deer running in the cornfield near the road. I slowed down for a second and watched them  then I heard this extremly loud screaching kind of howling sound. Im wasnt sure what it was we saw or heard that night  and wasnt much of a believer in bigfoot  but then this last summer I was watching wierd travels on the sci-fi channel. They were talking bout bigfoot  and they explained exactly what we saw  heard and smelled that night. I never mentioned anything about it till now for fear of critisizm. But i am now a strong believer in bigfoot  and want more than anyone to prove these amazing creatures exsist.,Bigfoot

We went running for the hills.  I carried the memory for many years and have never doubted that this was a true sighting.  The only person that believed was a school teacher that lived on that street who heard the inhuman sounds it was making.,Bigfoot
Report 1975: Couples hears late night scream in Loudon,It happened in the woods across from the NH International Speedway in the areas between Loudon and Chichester or so...big patch of woods out there very rural all the way to winnepesaukee.,NH,Well it was a few weeks ago in Loudon  NH.  Me and my wife had just settled into a house nestled next to a farm.  It was night time no real overcast or anything.  From inside the house we heard what we thought was barking constantly.  We own several dogs so we were used to it.  this continued for about an hour or two then quieted down.  Later on that evening about 2am or so we heard the most bloodcurdling sound ever.  The only way i can describe it is like about 20 dogs all screaming and yaulping at once in a shrill chorused scream.  We haven't heard it again but it came from across the farmer's field in the woods across from The speedway.  I'd have to say the date was around January 10th or so.  We have heard other things too and seen plenty of deer...but never heading across the field.  We don't know what it was and did not see it at all.  We have seen shadows move down the dirt road we live on but figured it was just someone walking up the road. Maybe we're just paranoid...but i've lived in the woods here a long time and never heard anything like that before.,Bigfoot

We are 2.2 miles past Errol  heading towards Colebrook  NH.,NH,Possible vocalizations on the 1400 acre farm we manage. This happened in the fall of 2014. I was outside on the deck and was listening to the coyotes out back. They were quite loud. I heard a howl like I have never heard before. I heard it 2 more times and then quiet. I have been out in the woods for most of my life. I have hunted extensively and never heard anything like this.,Bigfoot
Report 48354: Woman recalls scary night while at a Girl Scout campground in Bear Brook State Park,Don't know any closer than that. It was midnight with no street lights  just highbeam headlights  moon & stars. The west end of Deerfield Rd is Route 28 in Allenstown.,NH,"In one part of Bearbrook State Park is the Girl Scout Day Camp location. Across the street from New Rye Rd is the Camping Museum & the Snowmobile Museum. There used to be a nature museum. If you keep going straight on that dirt path  you wind yourself up into the Girl Scout Campground. It was a 2 week event. The older campers were allowed to have a single overnight in the last few days. It was '67/'68  late July. There were 3  5-person tents  I was a senior and in the tent closest to the woods. The evening was spent cooking hotdogs & hamburgers & marshmallows & sa'mores with lots of singing laughing & screaming. We all retired around 10 pm. In the middle of the night  around 1 or 2 am  I was woken by something softly grunting & pushing down on the top of the tent. We have racoons but no bears in (I get the irony) Bear Brook State Park. The other girls in my tent were trying to stay quiet  but still panicking not so quietly. I said "" it's just one of the other girls."" I am a camper since age 9 with a father who was a practical joker. So I said loudly ""That's not how you do it. This is how it is done"" & I dug my nails into the canvas & making a roaring growling sound clawed down the canvas hard & fast & hit something soft but solid on the outside of the cloth. I was picturing a man's hand/fist kind of like knuckles???. There was a loud grunt/growl & crashing away from us through the underbrush just on the other side of the tent. Now the girls in my tent are screaming hysterically about bears  The rest of the campers are opening my tent and all pandemonium broke loose. No-one admitted to playing a prank. & the leaders in the other 2 tents all day insisted everyone was accounted for & no one had left the tents not even a potty run. There was a funky smell though  that no-one could recognize. The park rangers swore there were none in the area  they were all up north for the summer. We had never heard of bigfoot  I fear I am repeating myself  so didn't even know such a thing existed. So  unexplainable incident  that with hindsight  I am thinking  could it have been??? The entire area  for square miles  has always been swarming w/ deer  even still  today.",Bigfoot
Report 55269: Dawn sighting at Stevens Brook outside Claremont,Close to Claremont down 120 not far from Kingston road.,NH,I was on my way to Claremont from Lebanon on Rte 120 and was passing by some reeds in a marshy area next to the road that sounded like a huge flock of birds. The creature came out of the reeds and was crouched down looking at me through them. Surprisingly it got out of the reeds from crouched to standing turned around and ran towards the wooded area up a hill and was moving with it's arms brush and tree branches out of the way. It was incredibly fast runner and I got a good look at its coconut shaped head as it ran away. It was light brown/brown. It had incredibly broad shoulders. I went back the same day. The marsh went up to my knees and I could smell a bad odor like garbage. Myself and a friend went back to the sighting. We found a footprint and a hair sample. I could hear wood knocks when my friend James did a call and we also found a large bed of branches and some tree structures. The following month I went back to Claremont and I heard screeching in the woods while I was traveling Rte. 120 on a bicycle.,Bigfoot
Report 52031: Family reports strange ongoing activity near Greenville,Not far from Russel-Abbott State Forest,NH,"I have not had a visual incident  but several strange experiences around my area recently have led me to try want to talk to someone who might know what is going on. Here I'll list the experiences: 1. I have a small orchard next to the forest in back of my house. 2 years ago  a young pear tree was bearing fruit for the first time  loaded with pears  there must have been 20-30 pears on it. I checked them one evening and decided that the next day I would come out and pick them. The next morning  I came out with a basket and every one of them was gone. Not only gone but every branch that had had a pear was broken. The top branches were about 10ft high so what ever took the top pears had to be tall. At the time  I didn't even consider a bigfoot and thought it might be a moose which we have go through the yard periodically. But I have not heard that moose eat pears and certainly not every one on the tree. Usually when deer eat my apples  they rarely eat more than 1/2 an apple at a time. Since that time I have put an electric fence around the orchard and the tree is recovering. 2. My workshop is down the street from my house  in my barn. About 1.5 years ago  I was walking up from the barn to the house and it was pitch black  in the evening. I could only barely see the road. Just before my house there is a patch of hemlock trees. As I passed the trees I encountered a very strong scent of wet dog. It had been raining all day but had stopped but everything was wet. The smell was overpowering and so strong that I stopped to see what it was. I peered into the trees but couldn't see anything. I walked past the trees and past the smell  walked back to the trees and the smell was still there. The trees are about 15-20 ft from the middle of the road where I was. I have to say I was a bit afraid as we do have some big bears around and didn't want to aggravate one  but I doubt a bear would have stayed still. My experience with bears is that they don't like being around humans and the ones around here are certainly not afraid of humans and usually just walk away. Whatever this was didn't move. So I went into the house. I definitely felt like I was being watched. 3. 1 year ago my wife and I were woken up around 1 am to the sound of a screaming woman in the woods  or what sounded like one. It was very loud  certainly louder than a woman would have been able to make  and it woke both of us up. After the screaming stopped  there was a pack of coyotes who yipped for a while from the same area. Then another sound of the woman screaming  then more coyotes  then more screaming and then more coyotes  then nothing. We went back to bed. We had heard the woman screaming sound before  years ago  in the middle of the day  and had gone out to find out what was going on but found nothing. We do have cougars here though and it may have been one of them. 4. A few weeks ago  at about 10 pm  my wife  myself and my son were sitting in the living room. It had been raining and foggy all day and was still drizzling out. It was pitch black and we couldn't see anything outside. All of a sudden  a rock hit the side of the house nearest the woods. It must have been about the size of a large marble. We immediately opened the door  but it was totally quiet and nothing more happened. 5. My daughter was visiting two weeks ago  and she was here for a week. She came on a Sunday and the next Friday she complained to me that she hadn't been able to sleep because of the screams in the woods. She asked me if I had heard them but I had slept through them. She said they were about midnight to 1 am and were accompanied by the sounds of a pack of coyotes. She described the screams but I of course cannot repeat them on this note  however  when she tried to repeat them  they are like nothing I've ever heard. She said they repeated for four nights. On Friday night  we stayed up trying to hear them but they did not reappear. 6. My daughter's dog stayed with us last fall for 5 months. She is a small black lab and loves to explore our field near the  woods. But many times  during the day even  when we went to let her outside  she refused to go out the door. She would sniff and then back away from the door. I still don't know why. Some days she would go out willingly  and some not. 7. The most recent was a few days ago. It was our first day above 90 degrees and I was traveling down Rte 31 north from Greenville along the Souhegan river. I was looking down the river on the right as the river arced away from the road and saw  some distance down the river  a large animal on all fours standing in the river.My first thought was that it was a bear. It was large  as the black bears we've seen around here are quite large. But it was cinnamon colored  quite a light color and the fur was at least 4"" long. I couldn't see its head. One of the bears here stood up against the screen door of my next door neighbor and my neighbor is 6'2"" and the bear stood as tall as he is  and I thought as I looked at this animal that it was at least that big. I know cinnamon is a variation of black bears  but the fur didn't look right  it was much too long and shaggy. The fur was so long that I couldn't see the joint between the legs and body. I should have stopped to get a better look but I was in a rush and didn't. 8. The last experience I had was in March. I was walking in the forest on a trail. In the distance  I heard someone hit a tree with a stick three times. I remembered that this is what bigfoot sometimes do from the online reports. I thought about that  and then walked on. About 100 feet later  it happened again. I thought  ""If this is a bigfoot  I don't want to meet him today"". I finished my walk without incident. So in sum  what is all this? Am I imagining something or what? Any suggestions? Do you have any similar reports from near here (southern NK)? I know bigfoot has been cited near here several times in the past in nearby towns.

Report 10046: Small group observed in a remote part of Essex County Swamp  around noon.,A 1/4 mile north of route 80 in a wooded swampy area.  The nearest habitation (at the time of sighting at least  was about 2 or 2 1/2 miles away),NJ,"This sighting happened in mid October 1971 in Fairfield  New Jersey.  It was a Saturday  sometime around noon. At the time I was 15 and my friend was 16.  We were walking throught a area that is primarily brushy woods  but alot of wet land with only clumps of  tall grass. We were walking in a westerly direction along a feeder stream that fed into the Passic River.  The Passic River is about 1/2 mile north of where we were. The area is quite flat.  The areas on the imediate left and right of the feeder stream had little brush. It was partly cloudy  and we were wearing light jackets.  From a distance of aproximetly 75 yards we observed 4 creatures.  The largest was standing on the south side of the stream.  It appeared to be about 8 feet tall  very long arms that went almost to the knees.  Very powerfully built  barrel chested  very wide shoulders.  the head seemed to have a rounded ""peak"".  The color of all 4 was black  the faces seemed somewhat lighter in color  but not white.  The second one was sitting on the ground  the third was lying on the stream bank  and the last was standing in the middle of the stream. We observed them for a few minutes.  They also observed us.  We discussed it and decided to run.  We ran back east for a bit until we came to a clear cut for power lines that ran north & south.  We ran south along the clear cut for aproximetly 1/4 mile until we came to Route 80. We went home.  The only people we told were our parents.  At no time did we feel threatened by the creatures.  We were used to being in the woods and knew the local fauna.  We both agreed these were not people or bears.  When I later the Patterson film  I felt that these were the same in appearence.",Bigfoot
Report 13515: Late afternoon sighting in the Pine Barrens,Edited out at witnesses request.,NJ,This sighting had happened when me and my girlfriend were driving on one of the dirt trails off Route 72.  We had just gotten on the trail and I wanted to stop for a second.  After being stopped for a few minutes  I looked up and noticed my girlfriend looked like she had just seen a ghost.  She said that she just saw something tall and light brown walk across the road we were on.  So I said it was probably just a deer or something. I got out and looked around  and I saw some bushes moving and heard some rustling.  As soon as I turned my head I saw this face of an animal about 6 feet high looking straight at me through this big pile of brush.  The face itself was black but the hair was a dark sandy to light brown color.  It looked like the face of an ape.  The hair on the top of its head was somewhat long. After looking at it for a few seconds I shook my head to see if i had seen what I thought I had  while I was doing so the animal had run away.  I saw it running for a second but then I turned back  to my car and got in.  Once I was in I asked her what she thought she saw.  She said that it was the same thing she had seen when we went camping six months prior to this. We went camping near Tuckerton but we had taken a detour to Apple Pie Hill.  There is a ranger lookout tower there  so went to the top and she looked down and said what the hell is that.  I pointed my flashlight in the direction but didn't see anything.  She said she saw something running in front of the tower and it looked like the same thing she had seen. But once I had gotten back into my car I looked around for it again but didn't see it.  So I put my window down and started driving  I could hear something running toward my car so I stopped and turned off my car again.  I still heard something coming my way  it sounded like a human or something running on two feet as opposed to a animal on 4 feet galloping through the woods.  After a few minutes of listening she was getting nervous so I had turned around and headed home.,Bigfoot
Report 34572: Man recalls hearing strange howls while camping in High Point State Park,Can't remember but I went back there many years later just to see it  was easy to find. Not a big state park.,NJ,"This happened roughly in 1990  High Point State Park in NJ. Camping with my much-younger siblings. I was about 23  they were about 8 and 9. Camping area was around a small lake. Picture a straight road with a left-hand turnoff to the camping area. Campsites were accessed by a horseshoe-shaped access road that went around the lake. Hillsides sloped up from the far (non-lake) side of the access road. A few folks were camping right near the turn off. We went all the way around the lake to the far side  away from everyone. It was about 20 yards from the access road to the lake -- we put up the tent close to the lake  so about 20 yards from our vehicle.  Made a fire. About dusk  from directly across the lake from where we were camped  up on the hillside there  we heard a long  loud howl. Will describe it later  but my little brother and sister asked what it was. I said  ""A moose "" knowing full well it wasn't but not really thinking much about it. After it got dark and we were roasting marshmallows  we heard the same sound  now closer to us  to the left. My siblings asked the same question  I gave the same answer. It started to drizzle so we went in the tent to sleep.  Sometime in the middle of the night  after we were all asleep  we were awoken by the same howl  except much closer and much louder than before.  So loud that if I had to yell at my brother and sister I'm not sure they could've made out what I was saying.  Same question  same answer. On the way out of the campground the next day  I asked the ranger on duty if he'd heard ""the howling last night."" He sort of laughed and said no. Like an idiot I thought he stayed there overnight  but he could've lived an hour away for all I know. Anyhow  I didn't remember any of this...UNTIL I was watching a ""strange creatures"" show ion late night cable about 8 years later  and heard a howl supposedly made by a bigfoot. Every hair on my arm stood up -- I remembered everything.  I called my siblings and asked them to play the sound -- found it on the nascent internet somewhere  I think.  They then remembered the noise too and were freaked out  but I don't think they remembered the details as well as I did because they were so young at the time. I've been an outdoorsman all my life and know and have heard every sound made by every known animal in the North American woods. This sound was not like any of those. I describe it as sounding like it was made by a huge man with at least 2x the lung capacity through a PA system. It was that huge  long and loud.  And remember  this was way before this stuff was on TV much and way before the Internet -- I was in no way influenced by that stuff. If I had any clue about it at the time  I wish I'd looked for tracks. It had been raining  and I'd bet that animal was near the truck on what I believe was a dirt road. Ah well. Incidentally  this experience ended up in me producing a novel  ""Dark Woods "" years later.  It was published but is out of print so this is not a plug!",Bigfoot
Report 10126: Possible night time sighting by a resident in the Carrizo neighborhood of Mescalero IR,Four miles north of Mescalero School.,NM,We hear screams almost every night throughout the spring and summer months. This particular incident occured after midnight  approximately 1:00am. I was awakened by all the neighborhood dogs barking. Even my dog was barking outside my window. Suddenly my dog began to cry. I sat up and walked into the living room and opened the sliding door enough to peek out side and listen to what the dogs were barking at. When I heard a loud scream like screeching then it turned into a loud holler. This screaming sounds went on for about ten minutes and came closer to my home. I then closed the sliding door and continued to peek out my living room window. I saw this tall hairy thing like a man standing next to the other window looking inside my home. I got down on all fours and began to crawl into the kitchen where he couldn't see me. I remained there for about five minutes  then looked toward the window where he was standing and could not see him. I crawled to the window and peeked out. I saw it walking into the dark carrying something in its hand. The next morning when I looked out my front porch my deer jerky that was hanging to cure was gone.,Bigfoot
Report 66089: Night time sighting on I-25 within Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge,The bigfoot was headed west toward the Gila National Forest  and away from the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge.,NM,Traveling south on interstate 25 on 12/24/1986. My wife and I both saw the bigfoot running across the hwy. I pulled over to shine my headlights on it. It had gone over an embankment. It must have squatted down because we never saw it again. The bigfoot was very tall  hairy  skinny  with long arms.,Bigfoot
Report 69437: Possible Sasquatch wood knocks in forested riverbed beside Chama during lockdown,This is probably not accessible now- we were able to walk back to the area due to everything closed by COVID.  Parked at the rail yard  crossed tracks and walked through the salvage yard area (unused railway equipment).  Followed path to Chama river  crossed at a rocky ford. Continued on the path along the river approximately a quarter mile.,NM,Summer of 2020 (quarantine year)  in late July  I was hiking with a friend along Rio Chama.  Although we were just on the other side of the river from town  the railroad was not running  the campground was closed  and the majority of the town was empty. This was a short day hike as we are seniors. We had a dog accompanying us (pit bull mix) for part of the way.  Before we reached the river we had to return the dog to the car- she became unusually excitable and fearful. Note: my friend and the dog live up on the mountain  the dog is used to wildlife and has treed a bear before. Anyway  windows down and dog much happier  we returned to our walk.  We had crossed the river and was on the trail that runs by the bank when we heard a series of hollow knocking sounds.  These were loud and resonate  not woodpeckers or falling branches.  A short time later they were repeated at a distance- the knocks sounded lighter in tone  like a hit on a more solid wood.  The knocks close to us responded- and we decided that it was in our best interest to leave the area.,Bigfoot

Report 43399: Scientist skeptic has early morning encounter behind gas station near Las Vegas  NM,It is the Southernmost gas station off of I-25 from Las Vegas  NM.  It is a large service center.,NM,"My wife and I were driving home from Denver  Colorado to Albuquerque  NM and stopped at a gas station in Las Vegas  NM (I believe it was a Philips 66) at approximately 0100 on 10/18/2013.  We pulled off of I-25 Southbound into the gas station parking lot.  When we were driving down the frontage road towards the gas station  we saw a few vehicles on the far end of the parking lot with 3-4 people talking and a NM State Police cruiser was leaving the lot  however  upon parking in front of the gas station  we discovered that it was closed.  I needed to pee rather urgently  so I ran around to the back of the station to find a dark place to do my business.  I walked about 15-20 meters behind the gas station to be out of sight of the occupied vehicles in the gas station lot.  As I was urinating I began to feel...uncomfortable.  I was peeing in open ground and initially thought somebody was walking up behind me (probably to do the same thing).  I craned a looked around and saw nobody and no animals; just a blanket feeling that somebody was very near me.  As I finished peeing  I turned and began briskly walking back towards our vehicle.  As I was hurrying back I turned to look behind me; and that is when I became a believer. Before I continue  I would like to preface my anecdote by alluding to my high-level of academic credentialing alongside my occupation as a healthcare executive.  I also provide executive and technical advise to elected and appointed officials; I have worked very hard to become an expert based on empirical analysis and studied fact.  I did not believe in Bigfoot  ghosts or another unexplained anomalies.  I believed in results  hard work and  well  results.  My perspective is now very different. As I turned and looked over my left shoulder  I saw an enormous  lurking animal.  The animal was crouched over  almost as if taking cover in the sparse and cold vegetation.  In fact  I think the creature watched me the whole time  and did not make so much as a noise.  However  the creature noticed when I saw it.  The creature stood up  and quickly lumbered into the dark away from the direction of the parking lot.  The one attribute of the creature that resounded with me was how heavy the footfall was.  It sounded like somebody dropping a sack of potatoes over and over again.  And it was fast.  I observed the creature for about 8-11 seconds  from the moment it realized I saw it  to watching the animal dart into the wood line.  Due to radiant light from the parking lot  I could make steady detail of the fleeing creature.  Here are the salient points from my memory (aside form the footfall): 1) The creature was approximately 8-10 feet tall.  I am 6""2 and this animal would have towered over me ( I observed it on flat land lending to my estimation). 2) The hair on the creature was matted  like dogs that live outside.  The coloration was dark brown. 3)  The creature had a defined gait.  It took strides that I would estimate to be 3-4 of my strides per 1 of it's strides. 4)  The creature had massive  human like hands. 5) The creature was very skittish  not moving until realizing I was observing it  lending to a higher intellect that a brown bear.  I believe the creature may have even fled in fear. 6)  I did not make eye contact  but noticed a massive brown and defined jaw and cranial structure. There is one other trait that I have since read about that may allude to this being a New Mexico Bigfoot.  The air was rank with what I thought was the dumpster behind the gas station.  However  this may be the ""musk"" eyewitnesses have reported in the past.  I cannot be sure  but it was very powerful  and somewhat reminiscent of what I perceived to be urine. This incident was fearful and moving.  I was unable to sleep for days and could not even bring myself to tell my wife until recently.  Due to my profession and reputation  I have extreme  extreme reluctance about openly sharing my encounter.  However  I have personal visual evidence of a so-called mythical beast  and I do not know what to do with it. Another fact: I have a concealed carry handgun license in the State of New Mexico and was carrying a 1911 .45 at the time of incident.  I was so scared that reaching for my weapon would have been an afterthought.  I was actually scared stiff.",Bigfoot
Report 5770: Four feral dogs chase sasquatch,Described in context above.,NV,"This is the third in a set of chronological reports that I am submitting regarding a series of encounters I had between 1970 and 1983 in Nevada  California  and Washington States. This third encounter occurred in August 1972  when I was 12  at my home  roughly ten days after our encounter at the dry wash. I have previously described nearby Peavine Mountain and Lemmon Valley.  Our house was located on the East side of the valley.  It was in a new development at the time  tucked back in a draw among several steep hills.  The surrounding hills rose from 50 to 250 feet above our neighborhood and were primarily granite outcroppings.  The soil was coarse granite sand interspersed with boulders of various sizes.  Where there was vegetation on the hills  it was predominantly sagebrush.  In the draws  the sand was less coarse and there were a variety of grasses and other weeds. We had just moved into the newly completed house a few weeks earlier and were getting to know our neighbors  all of whom had just moved into their new homes as well.  Like many of our neighbors  we were building a fence and otherwise improving our property.  At the time  there was only one thing to detract from the new neighborhood -- the presence of a pack of feral dogs. The pack was composed of four large dogs -- two Dobermans and a couple of mixed breeds.  They were a matter of some concern because many of the new residents had small children and the pack displayed absolutely no trace of fear of people.  They would generally appear around dusk  when it began to cool  and boldly range through the neighborhood.  At night you could often hear them in the surrounding hills  barking and baying occasionally.  It didn't take long to determine that they had no owner and one of our neighbors  an animal control officer for the city of Reno  told us that he had arranged for the county to do something about them. Our home was an ""L"" shaped ranch  with two of four bedrooms in the back  at the top of the ""L""  and a garage in front  at the bottom right of the ""L""  facing the street.  We had partially constructed a cedar plank fence around the property  starting in back and working our way around the property clockwise.  We had completed the fence on the side of the property at the top of the ""L""  and had built a small section of fence connecting the back left corner of the ""L"" to the fence on that side.  This created a small cul-de-sac behind the house.  Along the side of the property to the right of the ""L""  we had set the posts and rails.  Along the front  where we intended to connect it to the garage  at the lower right corner of the ""L""  we had set the posts  but hadn't yet put in the rails.  You could  essentially  walk right into our back yard from the street side of the house  but could not leave the yard on the back side without climbing over the fence. On the night of the encounter  I had picked up all of the two-by-fours we hadn't used as rails yet and I had stacked them horizontally along the base of the fence back in the cul-de-sac.  This was a precaution since they were pilferable and we weren't the only ones building a new fence. My bedroom was at the top  right corner of the ""L"".  The ground outside my window was about a foot and a half below the floor of my room.  My mother had already planted a small flowerbed of marigolds there.  To protect it  she had me put in one of those small  white-painted  wire trellises that reminds you of a bunch of coat-hangers welded together.  To put it in I had to heavily wet down the ground  then force it in.  Once the ground dried  the powdered granite and sand set like concrete.  It was about a foot high. The incident occurred between midnight and 12:30 am.  It was late summer and I was awake late reading.  I had my window open  but the drapes were closed.  That night  the pack of feral dogs had been more noisy than usual.  Every so often  their barking would become particularly strident  drawing my attention away from my book.  I remember thinking to myself  over the course of fifteen minutes or so  that they were chasing another jackrabbit  then deciding that it must be a coyote  since they'd been going at it for longer than usual  then wondering if they might have a cougar at bay  since they were still barking and baying loudly  but seemed stationary. I was just turning back to my book  when I realized that they had started moving again  and were coming down the street in the direction of the house.  I started to sit up  intending to go to the living room window to see what they were chasing  but realized that they would be well past the house before I could get to the living room in front.  As I listened  though  the noise of the pursuit didn't decrease the way I expected it to do as they chased their quarry past the opposite side of the house.  Instead it grew louder  and I realized that  whatever they were chasing  they were chasing it into our back yard.  I also realized that they might corner it behind the house in the cul-de-sac.  Excited  I started to get up to look out the window. Before I could get up  though  their quarry rounded the back right corner of the garage heading in the direction of my bedroom at the back right corner of the house.  For just a second  I could clearly hear it running  as the sound of the dogs was still partially masked around the corner of the garage.  As it covered the twenty feet between the two corners  I heard three distinct  heavy footfalls -- one just as it rounded the garage  one midway between the garage and the corner of the house  and the third just under my window  where the wire trellis was set firmly into the ground.  This was followed by an incredible impact into the corner of the house.  The force was so great that I could hear the four-by-four upright in the wall crack and the whole room shook.  The impact and cracking sound came from a point about five and a half feet above the level of the ground outside.  Simultaneously  there was a secondary impact about seven feet above ground level across the top right corner of my window as viewed from outside.  The window rattled violently in the frame and I was sure it was cracked.  Immediately following the two simultaneous impacts  there was a forced grunt as if the wind had been knocked out of whatever it was and I could hear its body fall heavily to the ground. My first thought was  ""Oh my God!  They're chasing a man!""  The footfalls were clearly bipedal  the height of the impacts was too high for it to be anything four-legged  and the sound of it having its wind knocked out was manlike  if somewhat heavy.  Also from the sound of its fall  it went from an erect to a prone position.  At the same time I recognized that something was strange.  The ""man"" hadn't called for help  hadn't made any vocal noises at all  in fact.  He had covered twenty feet in what was essentially two strides  and had hit the house at a point too high for all but the largest of men.  The secondary impact across the outside corner of the window was also too high for most people to reach  and the force of the impact  strong enough to make the four-by-four in the house's frame crack  indicated much more mass than any normal person would have. I didn't spend any time really thinking about this  though.  Even though I had an underlying uneasiness because the sounds indicated that the guy was huge  I was sure the dogs were chasing a man.  The dogs closed on the man  snarling and barking.  I was afraid he was lying on the ground  injured or unconscious  and I realized that I had to do something.  I immediately threw my sheet off  jumped out of bed  and reached for the drapes  intending to throw them open and yell at the dogs -- about all I could do in the situation.  In the two or three seconds it took to do this  though  it didn't sound like the dogs were mauling the man.  They were about three feet from the house  stationary  barking and growling.  It sounded as if there were only three of them  two very aggressive and ready to attack  and one that was barking the way a dog would if it were afraid of you  but ready to attack if provoked. Just as my fingertips touched the drapes  the scariest thing I have ever experienced in my life happened (believe me  this is saying a lot for someone who has spent nineteen years in the military and lived through a parachute malfunction).  Somehow the man had recovered from hitting the house  having the wind knocked out of him  and falling.  He had somehow managed to stand up and get his breath back and just as I touched the drapes  from a point immediately outside my window  level with and about two feet from my head  He Growled Back at the dogs. The growl wasn't loud.  It was only about two and a half seconds long.  But it was the meanest  deepest  and most menacing growl I have ever heard in my life (to include those of trapped brown bears at Yellowstone).  It was almost as if he was keenly aware that there were people around  that he knew precisely how long he had to growl to get his point across  and that he didn't want to make any more noise than he absolutely had to. For the next several seconds there was absolute silence.  He didn't make any more noise.  The dogs didn't even make any sounds of movement.  And I was frozen in fear and shock  praying that he wouldn't notice I was there  and afraid he would hear me if I moved at all. It was like that for several long seconds  then  all but silently  I heard him step and brush around the corner of the house. A second later the dogs were after him  but the head start was all he needed.  I heard the stack of two-by-fours tumble down and the sound of him hitting the six foot cedar fence as he went over it  followed by the dogs hitting the fence and then scratching at it and barking.  After a few moments the dogs stopped trying to get over the fence and raced back around the house clockwise. As I heard the dogs racing down the street  I relaxed slightly and gulped for breath.  I hadn't even realized I'd been holding it.  I immediately choked.  The ""Thing"" had left an incredible stench.  It was overpowering.  It smelled like a combination of wet dog  stale urine  and rancid sweat.  There was also an acrid component a little like burnt rubber.  It was so bad that I staggered away from the window. I stood there for a few moments trying to decide what to do.  The thing was gone  the dogs were gone  and all I would accomplish by waking my parents would be to anger my father.  I decided it wasn't worth it.  I thought about going outside but really didn't want to poke around out there in the dark.  I was struggling with what I had just experienced.  Whatever had been outside my window was manlike  but clearly was not a man.  I had no frame of reference to place it in.  I didn't relate the experience to my encounter at the dry wash because I had so thoroughly convinced myself that that had been a man.  I closed my window (which to my amazement was not broken)  got back in bed  and tried to read to get my mind off of the incident.  Eventually I fell asleep. The next morning I woke after my father had left for work.  I looked out my window and could see that the flowerbed -- trellis and all -- had been flattened.  I got dressed and went outside.  The ground was scuffed but there were no distinctive footprints.  I choked down my apprehension and walked back into the fenced cul-de-sac behind the house.  The stack of two-by-fours was lying there toppled.  I looked at the cedar fence.  The scratch marks from the dogs' nails were clear.  Caught on the top of one of the planks was a tuft of coarse hair.  I stepped up on the lower rail of the fence and looked at it closely in the bright morning sunlight.  It was dark black with hints of brownish red highlights and about three inches long.  It had enough oil on it make it shine if you looked at it closely.  I struggled with whether it had come from the ""thing"" or one of the dogs.  After several moments of consideration I decided it was possible one of the Dobermans could have had some three inch strands of hair  that the colors were within the appropriate range  and that one of the dogs might actually have managed to make it over the fence to leave it there.  I left it where it was. I went back to the window and examined it and the siding on corner of the house closely.  I didn't see any damage from the impacts.  I decided that the thing had been running  hadn't seen the trellis  and had tried to cut around the corner of the house too closely.  The trellis  strongly embedded in the cement-like soil  tripped it and it fell  throwing its left arm(?) up in an attempt to maintain balance (or maybe grab the roof to catch itself).  The primary impact would have been from its body.  The secondary impact could have been from the left arm slapping the side of the house across the corner of the window. I went in and told my mother about the incident.  I was still very troubled and wanted to know what I had heard.  I discussed it at length with my father when he got home.  He was uncharacteristically patient and explained that it had either been a bear or a cougar.  I couldn't accept either of these explanations.  It wasn't until about a year later that I ran across a tourist pamphlet in Oregon that was about Bigfoot.  I can't express how relieved I was at the time to learn that there was a potential explanation for what I had experienced. We never saw or heard the dogs again after that night.",Bigfoot
Report 5697: Three boys encounter sasquatch in eroded terrain,Described in context above.,NV,"This is the second in a set of chronological reports that I am submitting regarding a series of encounters I had between 1970 and 1983 in Nevada  California  and Washington States. I grew up several miles Northwest of Reno  Nevada in the foothills of the Sierra's.  My father was a geologist who preferred sparsely populated areas  so we lived  camped  fished  gold panned  rockhounded  and hunted Indian and goldrush artifacts in some relatively remote places. This second encounter occured in August of 1972 in Lemmon Valley  Nevada.  Lemmon Valley is Northwest of Reno on US 395.  Though the area I am about to describe is now covered with housing developments  in 1972 there were only two developed areas in the valley.  Stead Air Force Base (deactivated in 1959)[N.B. below] was on the West side of the valley and the community of Lemmon Valley was on the East side.  The community of Lemmon Valley was  in reality  simply a strip of built up properties along Lemmon Valley road - just housing and few small businesses extending for about five miles toward the back of the valley and for a couple of hundred yards at most to either side of the road.  US 395 cut across the South and higher end of the valley at the base of Peavine Mountain's North slope.  Toward the back of the valley  the North or lower end  were a few small ranches.  Only a couple of improved dirt roads cut across the center of the valley connecting the community of Lemmon Valley to Stead. The climate was high desert.  Roughly 5000 feet in elevation with negligible year-round rainfall  but sometimes several feet of snow in the winter.  The humidity was generally less than ten percent and often as low as five.  Other than those planted near developed properties  there were no trees in the floor of the valley.  Scrub pine begins on the higher ridges about five miles West of the valley and thickens to fully developed arid pine forest as the elevation increases.  The dominant vegetation is sagebrush  mixed with a wide variety of large weeds and coarse grasses.  Jackrabbits  prairie dogs  and smaller rodents were very common  as were a wide variety of lizards and snakes.  Coyotes are common  but rarely seen.  Cougar and black bear are rare  but sometimes sighted in the area.  Deer stick to the surrounding higher elevations with more trees.  Other indigenous animals include hawks  falcons  and few burrowing owls.  Quail  and other ground nesting birds are also plentiful.  There is also a variety of large insect species (cicada  locusts  etc..) to round out the ecosystem.  At first glance  the area may not look like it supports much in the way of life  but it actually does.  Snow melt is the primary source of open water in the late spring and early summer and a small lake forms toward the back of the valley.  By late August this has usually dried up and the only sources of water are near human habitation. As I mentioned in my first report  the North face of Peavine Mountain was deforested in the late 1800's.  It has also eroded significantly over the last century as a natural result of the vegetation loss and due to hydraulic mining.  The runoff from the mountain was clearly heavy at some time in the past  because two deep washes cut through half the length of the valley flowing North from Peavine Mountain. These washes were eight to ten feet deep in places with vertical walls and averaged five to eight feet in width.  Walking down one was much like walking through a school hallway with slight curves.  Their depth would increase and decrease as they intersected the natural fingers and draws running down from the ridges that bounded the valley.  They were difficult to climb in and out of except at a few places where they shallowed out to a couple of feet as they intersected a draw.  Because they were shaded and contained a little more moisture than the surrounding terrain  they formed a small microclimate where certain species of lizard and an occassional scorpion could be found.  The sagebrush also grew a little taller (about three feet) along their edges.  Below  the floors of the washes were almost perfectly level  shaded  and protected from the wind.  Very little vegetation grew in the floors of the washes and was usually limited to tumbleweeds and some patches of coarse grass.  From the floor of the valley these washes were virtually invisible.  You could only tell where they were from a stripe of sagebrush running along their edges that was a little greener  thicker  and taller than the rest of the sagebrush in the valley.  You couldn't see them or see down into them until you were right on top of them. This encounter took place in the early afternoon in mid-August of 1972.  It was bright  sunny  and hot  about 85 degrees Fahrenheit  at the time.  The wind was less than five miles per hour.  I was twelve.  I was with my brother  who was ten  and a friend  David  who was also twelve.  For years  my brother and I had spent the summers exploring the surrounding hills and valley.  We knew all the best places to catch each type of lizard  the best places to look for arrowheads  where the trash dumps from the 1800's were (good for old bottles)  and the best places to find old shell casings and such from when the airbase had been active.  We didn't often make it out as far as the dry washes  but when we did we made a point of exploring them because of the unique things like scorpions you could find in them.  We had just moved from Stead to the Lemmon Valley side of the valley and David  a new neighbor  was with us for the first and  as it turned out  only time. We had decided to go all the way out to the closest wash to show it to David  and were angling toward one of the shallow points where it would be easier to get into.  As we walked along we were searching the ground for horned toads  arrowheads  and anything else that might be interesting.  We were about twenty feet from the wash when we stumbled across an area with jasper and obsidian chips on the ground and started looking around in earnest for arrowheads and other stone tools.  My brother and I were seriously competitve when it came to hunting arrowheads. I was facing North  focusing on a piece of jasper I had just found  and had my back to my brother and David when I got a sudden feeling something was wrong.  I don't know whether I heard one of them gasp or just go abruptly quiet  but I knew there was a problem.  I had a sense of where my brother was a few feet behind me and turned to look at him.  As I turned clockwise from North to South I saw first David  about twenty-five feet away from me and a couple of feet from the rim of the wash  then what I perceived to be a giant black man about eight feet from David and about three feet away from the wash  and finally my brother  who was only about five feet behind me.  The giant black man was about thirty-five feet from me  standing still facing me with his arms at his sides looking directly at me (I guess he must have figured I was the lead male).  David was in shock  rooted to the ground  staring directly at him with his mouth wide open and his lower jaw level with his collarbones.  My brother was poised to run and looking from the ""man""  to me  and then to David in a panic.  As soon as I saw the man I took a step to run also  but realized David wasn't going anywhere and we'd need to help him if the ""man"" tried to do anything (we weren't that far from Reno and there are a lot of weird people who drift through that town - a man out of place in the desert is immediately considered dangerous).  I settled my weight and looked the ""man"" in the eye waiting for him to indicate his intentions. This all took about a second.  At this point my brother turned to me and screamed  ""That's not a man!  That's not a man!""  Not breaking eye contact with the ""man"" I snapped back at him  ""Yes it is!""  My brother immediately yelled ""No  it's not!"" and I snapped right back ""Then what is it?""  which shut him up.  At that moment  in that situation  it was critically important to me that the ""man"" be nothing more than a man.  I also knew my brother and I could probably get away  but David was at risk and I intuitively sensed that it was important to control the fear  both by keeping the ""man"" just a man and by calming my brother. As I focused on the ""man"" I recognized that he was not overtly threatening but seemed stern and annoyed.  He didn't move a muscle and he didn't make a sound.  From his manner I gathered that he was not threatening us  but was determining if we were a threat to him - that we had disturbed him and he just wanted us to go away and leave him alone.  My brother and I would have been happy to oblige but David was still standing like a statue and we weren't leaving him behind so we all just stood there and stared at each other. I could see the ""man"" from the lower shins on up  and this is where it gets a little strange.  He was at least eight and a half feet tall  three and a half feet to four feet broad at the shoulder  and had a comparatively narrow waist.  His arms hung down to the top of his knees.  Not only was this ""man"" huge and slightly disproportionate  but in the middle of the afternoon  in the middle of August  to my perception  he was wearing a black down ski parka with the peaked hood up  matching black down ski pants  and black gloves.  Down ski-wear was a brand new fad with the skiers that came through Reno back then.  I thought to myself that it was strange that he had this brand new ski outfit  let alone one that fit his frame.  I thought he must have stolen it (I had already subconsciously assumed this guy was a hobo because we were at least a mile from the nearest road  there wasn't a vehicle in sight  and I couldn't think of a good reason for him to have apparently been hiding in the wash).  As I thought about it  the hobo assumption made sense.  The ski-suit was probably the only thing he had to wear and  at night  sleeping out in the open in the high desert it tended to get a little chilly  August or not.  There was even a little dirt on it in places  indicating he'd been lying on the ground in it. The ""man's"" bearing  though  didn't come across the way a homeless person's would.  He stood tall with his shoulders relaxed  but back.  His posture indicated a sense of self-worth that was almost regal and his gaze didn't flinch (as an afterthought  there was nothing about his eyes to give me the impression that he lacked human intelligence).  Even under the ski suit you could tell that he had a massively muscled upper body  and the ratio of shoulders to waist were those of a world-class athlete.  For a moment I considered that I was looking at fur-covered muscle and immediately killed the thought  then started to look a little closer anyway.  This was when he simply broke eye contact  turned  stepped down into the wash at the shallow point where he was standing and walked away down the wash without looking back (this was a little strange in retrospect because there was absolutely no indication in body language or eye movement to telegraph that he had decided our encounter was over - he simply turned and left without acknowledgement).  Within a couple of steps he disappeared around a slight curve in the wall of the wash as it cut through the next finger off of the ridge.  We had stood looking at each other for maybe forty-five seconds. I didn't move for a couple of seconds after he disappeared  waiting to give him time to go before moving to check on David.  I'd never seen anybody so afraid that they were frozen on the spot before and I was concerned about him.  As I walked up to David  looking cautiously down the wash as I got a better angle on it  my brother followed me and said in a voice that seemed to beg me to believe him  ""That wasn't a man.""  Standing in front of David  I looked him in the eye and said  ""Yes it was.  It was just a big  black hobo.""  That ended the discussion.  I asked David if he was ok.  He just shook his head yes and didn't say anything.  My brother moved up to the edge of the wash to see as far down it as he could and I asked if he could see the guy.  He couldn't and we started to leave when curiosity got the better of us and my brother asked  ""What do you think he was doing down there?""  I thought about it for a second and decided I wanted to know  too  so we walked along the edge of the wash for a hundred yards or so to make sure he wasn't hiding close enough to threaten us (the guy wasn't carrying anything and I was worried that we would find his camp about the time he came back to it to get his belongings).  We walked back down to the shallow spot in the wash and jumped down into it.  I briefly recognized that the ""man"" had simply stepped down the three feet I had just jumped  but didn't say anything. We walked both up and down the wash a hundred feet or so looking for a campsite.  We didn't find one.  No firepit  no food wrappers  no trash  no drug paraphenalia  no signs that a human had been camping there.  The floor of the wash was granite sand so there really weren't any footprints that I could recognize to indicate where he may have been.  We did find a spot where someone had taken pieces of tumbleweed and sticker bush and embedded them in the wall of the wash.  Tumbleweed and pieces of bush were also arranged on the floor of the wash at the same spot.  Those embedded in the wall of the wash were arranged in a tall half-oval with the peak about four and a half feet high.  Those on the floor of the wash were also arranged in a half oval that joined the first.  It was about the right size for the guy to sit cross-legged in with his back against the wall of the wash. At that time I had never heard of Bigfoot  so it wasn't even an option for me to consider within the framework of the encounter.  Even though several things about the encounter were strange I convinced myself that we had been confronted by a man.  What else could it have been?  About ten days later  though  something happened that forced me to admit that there was something in the valley that was manlike but wasn't a man.  I'll submit that as my third report soon.",Bigfoot
Report 20780: Hikers spot a dark figure walking on a snowy mountainside near Winnemucca,You can see the mountain from on the outskirt's of town. You can basicaly see the peak of the mountain that the sighting occured.,NV,"My uncle  my six year old cousin  and I were on one of our little weekly expeditions to explore the surrounding mountains in Winnemucca  Nevada. We were walking up the foot of a mountain on the ridge of a wash and there was still about a foot and a half of snow on the ground when my cousin said that she saw a guy standing on top of the mountain and I said ""There's no one up there  it's to far from any civilizations. It's probably just a juniper bush."" But about five minutes later  our 95 pound Doberman/Greyhound mix made a mad dash underneath the truck by the foot of the mountain. (And our dog was not one to be scared off easily  it scare's away anything that comes close to the house  and it even took on a mountain lion once  it has the scars on it's underbelly to prove it.) Just about the time me and my Uncle looked up towards where my cousin was pointing  we heard a low  droning howl and what I thought was the juniper bush  was animated now  walking downwards  and swaying side to side slightly. It spooked me and my uncle because on the way up we saw a totally decimated cow carcass! About that time we headed out to the truck because we were pretty shaken up by what we had just seen. We were reluctant to tell anyone in fear of being laughed at and ridiculed.",Bigfoot
Report 5909: Two Hikers Have Close Encounter Near Genoa,Go to the town of Genoa.  Drive north on Foothill Rd. turn left on Centennial past the cemetary.  The road ends up behind some residential homes but where the road ends the land belongs to the Forestry/BLM and is the start of the trail head.  It is a tough hike but eventually you will come to the remaining foundation of the deer hunter's cabin.  It was in this vacinity where we met this large  hairy  smelly guy near the creek. Going uphill the creek will be on your left.,NV,"In Sept. 1984 my friend and I were hiking on the east side of the Sierra Nevada Mtn. Range above Lake Tahoe and the Carson Valley above the town Genoa.  Both of us grew up in this area.  Although in high school I was kind of a cut up  my friend Linda  graduated valedictorian of our class 5 years earlier.  She is very logical.  We have often hiked this trail that basically goes straight up the mountain and over to Tahoe.  It is a strenuous hike.  When we parked our truck at the trailhead there was another car parked there as well.  We were 1/4 the way up the trail when two teenage boys came running down the mountain towards us.  The trail was extremely steep and they were running for all they were worth.  They stopped long enough to implore us not to go any further up the mountain as they had seen a monster or something.  There was an old deer hunter's cabin at about the half way point and we told the boys that we were only going to go that far.  (We thought they were drinking or on drugs) We shrugged off the incident laughed and joked that we wished we had what they were ""smoking."" We reached the cabin without incidence sat down on the bluff that overlooked the Carson Valley we split a soda that we had brought and I took out my recorder (flute like instrument) and began playing some little tunes on it.  We were alone on the mountain we thought. After about an hour of putsing around we decided to head back down the trail.  I kept smelling dog doo or something dead.  I even checked my shoes.  We were near the creek gathering pine cones for an art project  I was facing downhill  Linda was facing uphill  we were examining a particularly perfect cone when Linda looked up and exclaimed  ""Oh  my God it's a bear  no....it's a guy in a bear suit!""  I looked up and couldn't believe it  we were a stone toss from a 7 ft. hairy dude.  He looked directly at us and to this day Linda and I felt something pass between the three of us.  He stood across the creek from us.  His hair was the color of dry pine needles and covered his whole body with the hair thinning just on his chest and face. He had a large broad chest  but not breasts like a female  his arms were hanging at his sides nearly to his knees and when he walked  he took long strides and his arms swung freely as he walked. He didn't seem to fear us although he began to walk straight up a pine needle covered slope  barefooted  without slipping. As he moved away Linda grabbed my arm and began dragging me down the hill I couldn't take my eyes off him and he never took his eyes off us.  I do not feel to this day as he meant to harm us but instead I feel he was just as fascinated with us as we were with him.  His face seemed almost serene with very intelligent eyes - his face resembled an orangutan. He had large eyes and a flattish nose I sketched a picture as soon as I got home and Linda confirmed that I had captured his likeness - I wished I had a camera on me that day.  As we continued at a fast pace down the hill he remained on the ridge above us paralleling in the same direction. We reached our truck and could still see him crouching on a granite boulder at least a football field distance between us.  I yelled up to him that he was very cool but he shouldn't be scaring the crap out of us locals.  He stood up on his boulder and Linda told me to shut up and get in the truck.  We were strangely disturbed that afternoon and evening.  We thought of going to the forest service or the sheriff’s dept.  But crimeny sakes  who would've believed us?  Plus in our community they would just want to shoot him. We have since hiked there many times.  Always hoping to catch another glimpse.  We are married ladies with kids and we take the kids up ""Bigfoot Canyon"" periodically in search of our elusive friend. A few years ago the wind blew down some trees during a storm and exposed an area that we had not seen from the trail before.  When we went up to investigate we found a large boulder and some older pine trees with branches low to the ground around it.  You could duck down and go under the trees near the wall of the boulder and it looked as if something or someone had made a natural shelter there.  The pine needles had all been tramped down and it seemed to be away from the prevailing winds.  A great place for deer  bear or perhaps a bigfoot.  We hope so.  I will never look at life on this earth the same way.  I have seen bigfoot and not only does it make for a great tale around the campfires at night  it fuels my imagination about every little sound I hear when I am in the wilderness.  I am intrigued.  I only hope that no harm comes to the Bigfoots.  I believe that the great creator of all life shares the sight of the Bigfoot with people who might grow from the experience. I know Linda and I have both grown.  Even if we share the experience with someone who doesn't believe us - it really does not matter.  We know what we saw.  He was so close in proximity it was obvious to us that this fella belonged here.  He was as natural as the sky  creek  trees and the deer.",Bigfoot
Report 3455: Two security guards see a creature outside of Gold Hill,take hwy.50 east out of Carson . turn left onto 431 through Silver City just before you get to Gold Hill there is a drive to the left across from New York mine. siting was at old mill site at American flats in ravine just south of ruins of old mill.,NV,"I was a reserve deputy sheriff for Story co. Sheriff's office. I was employed by Houston International Minerals Corp. at Gold Hill as their on site security supervisor. I had worked the day shift. I had ran some kids out of the old mill at around 3:30pm on 09-15-80. I was showing my swing shift officer the area I had ran the kids off from. We were in the security vehicle parked on the high side of the southside of the old mill (Gold Mining). We saw that the boys  (four of them) were running back down the ravine to the creek below. it was 4:15pm. As the boys reached the creek they must have scared a group of girls at the creek bottom because they started screaming. there was a lot of noise being made by both the girls  and boys laughing  and yelling. At first I thought they had scared a deer west of them near the rock outcrops. Then I thought  no it's too big to be a deer. I could see it moving amoung the trees heading up the other side of the ravine at a very fast pace. I thought it must be a lone mustang as I watched. My secutity officer got the binoculars from the seat and said ""OH MY GOD"" I looked closer  and realized it was not a mustang. I was looking at a large greying/ brown man shape thing about ten plus feet tall. It was obviously male. because of it's build. As it cleared the trees near the top of the hill I could clearly see it. It was covered with hair from head to toe. Greying like a person in their fifties. It was at least three feet across at the shoulders. At the crest of the hill it turned to look back down the ravine. It was maybe a hundred yard across the ravine. I had an unobstructed view at this point. It stood on the hill top maybe a minute looking back down the hill  then turned and moved over the other side of the hill out of view. We drove over to where we had seen the thing last (about a two mile drive on dirt roads). It's was about 4:50 pm by then  We saw no further sign of it  but was able to establish that the thing was standing next to a tree that was 11 feet tall  and it was just as tall as the tree we saw.",Bigfoot

Report 27035: Man recounts childhood incident at his home on Oneida Lake,This occurred along the shore of eastern Lake Oneida area adjacent to the southern boundary of Verona Beach State Park.,NY,"When I was 11 years old I was living with my mother and step-father in upstate New York. Our home was on the shores of Oneida Lake and bordered the southern boundary of Verona Beach State Park. One evening shortly before Halloween I had gone to bed late about 10pm. The window in my bedroom was directly behind the head board of my bed  and one of only three street lamps beamed light through this window. The height of the bottom of the window frame was approximately 6 feet above the ground. My bedroom window was also the only window in the house that faced our neighbor's house. The neighbors house was about 8 to 10 feet away with no french between the properties. On this particular night the light from the street light shown brightly into my bedroom and lit the entire room well enough to almost be able to read by its light. A few minutes after going to bed a ""figure"" moved into the light and cast a huge shadow on the opposing wall of my room. I amassed that this figure had to be standing with in only a few feet of my bedroom window do to the sharpness and size of the shadow. Also  considering the size of the shadow and the height of my window above the ground the figure had to stand at least 7 to 8 feet tall to cast such a shadow. I froze in my bed (and embarrsingly enough  I had wet myself in fright). I could not muster the strength to look out the window  I simply froze. the shadow remained for all of about 20 to 30 seconds  then it was gone. About three to four minutes later heard a very loud crash of wood and metal as someone or something had ripped off the door to our back storage room. I heard someone or something moving items  then I heard the big freezer chest open (and the toys I had left on the freezer fall to the ground). Again  I was still frozen with fear and in my bed  and could not moved. There were some loud bumps and bangs as if something was throwing bricks around the storage room (our storage room was approximately 16 feet by 32 feet and attached to the back side or lake side of the house). After the banging stopped the freezer lid slammed shut and all banging stopped. Later that night my step dad and mom had come home from work around 3am (they owned the restaurant a few blocks away) and started screaming and my mom was very very panicked. My mom called one of her friends that was also a good customer and was a State Trooper. I don't know what was said between them. The next morning my step dad and two of his friends were trying the fix the door to the back room. This is when I first saw the damage done. The room looked as if it were turned upside down  then right side up. My step dads large roll-away tool box was on its side and on the other side of the room  and packages of frozen meet were all over the place. A car transmission had been tossed as if a toy. The freezer had some faint scratches on the side and on the lid  but no tool marks or pry bar marks (my parents normally kept the freezer locked). These same scratches were located on the side of the house and the removed door. Missing were packages of my mom's frozen strawberries  and two frozen turkey's. None of the prepackage streaks or hamburgers  or lobsters were taken (they used this freezer as a back up to the freezer at the restaurant). The State Trooper friend of my Mom's said that it looked like three or four people had to of done this  but could not offer an explanation to the faint scratch marks. When I told my mom of the shadow figure my mom would only start to cry and hug me  saying we were so lucky that God had protected me from this situation. Of note was the conversation between my step dad and our neighbor. Our neighbor told my step dad that he too had seen some kind of shadowy figure moving between the houses. Our neighbor said he had tried to let his dog out to investigate  but the dog would not go outside. But as soon as the figure appeared  it had gone away  and he had gone back to watching tv. Our neighbor did not hear any of the knocking or bangs in our back room. At this age I had not ever heard of Bigfoot. But later  (the next spring) the other boys were talking about a ""monster"" called bigfoot that had been on TV  and for the first time (since that night)I froze again in fear (for a few seconds this time) and somehow knew what they were talking about  and what they were describing.",Bigfoot

This was my post on www.westchesterfishing.com Low and be hold another member at the same reservior..Columbus day 2011..this is his post..Hey Guys  I put at Amawalk this summer and about the 5th time I took it out in early October.  I saw two upright walking chimp looking things walk out of the woods and crouch down and drink from the res  run back in to the woods and then do the same thing again.  When they came out the second time one of them threw it's arms in the air while squatting and then they ran back into the woods.   The second one went back slowly.  It seemed like they saw something in the water right in front of them.  That was right when the sun came up.  I haven't been back to my boat since.  I have no idea what they were and looked like two large chimps to me.  Maybe some guy who lives there has two monkeys or something?  I have no idea.  But I saw something that I can't explain  it has been eating away at me since.  When I saw the preview for that show I almost shat myself.  When Biggame posted here I didn't want to say that I saw something because I'm from Oregon and my hunting and logging part of the family thinks they know where they live but none of them have never ever seen them just have stories  just like everyone else in Oregon.  Then I saw what I saw in October and have been denying it to myself ever since.  I absolutely hope that someone owns two monkey's on the Amawalk. I have no reason to say something like this.  Before October I could have cared less if bigfoot existed  now I'm a bit curious.  I own a fishing rod company and have business to lose from people thinking I'm crazy for posting this on here.  This is a nothing to gain and allot to lose situation for me but  I had to say something when Biggame posted.  Let me be clear in saying that I saw something too.  I have no idea what they were and would need absolute proof that bigfoot existed before I would ever say thats what they were. So two seperate sightings same place different year..I BELIEVE!!!",Bigfoot

Report 4081: Early morning sighting of young sasquatch in snow,Ravine at entrance to Hafer Park  at 9th and Bryant.  The ravine runs parallell to Bryant. From I-35  take Edmond Road (2nd St) west to Bryant  then south on Bryant to 9th.  This is the entrance to Hafer Park.,OK,"Winter  1982: On this occasion  there had been a big snowstorm  and nothing was moving on the streets.  There weren't even any tire tracks.  I was about fifteen years old  and worked at a fast-food restaurant about a mile north of this location  and was forced to walk home because my father had called and told me that conditions were so bad he couldn't get the car out of the drive.  The heavy blanket of snow made visibility good  reflecting light as it does.  As I cleared some trees to the east  I observed movement to my left through peripheral vision  and looked to my left into the ravine  and saw a figure apparently playing in the snow. For an instant  I thought that it was a child wearing a dark colored snow suit  but as the moment passed  I became very aware that this was no child.  I had a very clear view of it  and could see that it was black  or very close to black  and covered with long hair or fur from head to toe.  It was probably around five feet tall  and weighed about 160lbs. The creature continued playing in the snow  bending over at the waist  and throwing snow up into the air with both hands in a wide scooping motion  throwing it up so that it came back down on its head.  It also began rolling in the snow. I felt stark terror at the sight of the thing.  I was also very unnerved knowing that I was very far from any residential area  in the early morning  and that there was absolutely no traffic on the road. The creature was only about thirty to thirty-five yards from me  and I had about an eighth of a mile to clear until I was out of sight of the creature.  I thought about running  but I feared that my footfall and rapid motion would catch the thing's attention and that it would then begin chasing me as is instinctive for a lot of animals. The point is  I had quite a bit of time to view this thing  and the longer I looked at it  the more I realized that what I was looking at did not fit any rational explanation.  Once I was out of sight  and I thought I was out of earshot  I ran as fast and as far as I could. This area is now a park  Hafer Park  but at the time  nothing was there but a wooded area and the ravine  which is a drainage ditch.  Even now  with the park  there is still a good deal of wooded area there. David A. Farris  author of ""Mysterious Oklahoma "" says that locals have dubbed this creature the ""skunkape "" reportedly because of its terrible odor.  I did not smell anything in this incident  but I have a very poor sense of smell and serious sinus and allergy problems which are routinely exasperated by the cold weather.",Bigfoot
Report 3240: Father and son observe hand print and footprints near old logging road,Coming south on Highway 259 you travel about 5 miles of the junction of 259 & 4 (which heads back to Smitville proper). On the east side of 259 you will see a low water crossing that crosses Mountain Fork river you follow that logging road 2 miles to the east. At the two mile mark the road Y's back south there is a pond on the south side to mark this spot. You take this logging road about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile further and you will see the steep bank off the road on your right hand side (west). I will include more precise directions here below: Using the Smithville Quadrangle 7.5 minute topo map the UTM coordinates are as follows: Zone 15 347964E 3806266N This area sits between Hee Mountain which is to the south and Mountain Fork River which is north.,OK,"While my son and I were camping in the Quachita National Forest on Oct 19 2001  in McCurtain County we discovered 4 large foot prints and one large hand print. We were off one of the logging roads that wind through out the forest. I came upon a area that had a very steep cut out along the bank off the road. This cut off had exposed the underlining strata  and I thought it would be a good time to show my son some geology of the area. The exposed strata was layered and I could show my son (18 years old) how the rock and soil was layered by water over thousands of years. We went up to the bank and was starting to show him the layers when suddenly my son said ""Dad look at this print"" it turned out that it was a very large hand print. After further investigation we found 4 large foot prints. The prints were in a single line and you could follow the prints for a space of roughly 15 -20 feet. We did not have a tape measure or ruler to measure accurately so every measurement is a guesstimation. The first print seen is a left foot  then comes right foot about two feet away  then comes left foot about 8 feet further up then about 3-4 foot away and slightly higher up the (what I will call for lack of a better term alluvial fan  because off this bank the soil and rock is washed down into a pattern like that off larger areas such as the sides of mountains  etc.) Following the left hand print comes another left foot print about 3 feet away  however this print only shows the toes and about 1/2 of the foot it appears to have been made while the foot was rotating off the ball and toes  and stopped at what with some caution I will call the arch. (I say that because there does not seem to be much if any arch at least like a normal human foot.) Following this print is another large print however this print seems to be out of place as that it is perpendicular to the others and headed further up the debris pile. After this the tracks stop. There are some others there that I think were at one time prints however they were deteriorated to the point where it would be impossible to ID. The material in this wash is a combination of small chat like material mixed with the native soil (clay based sandy loam). It is not a material that is condusive to holding any print of any kind for very long and they will be gone totally after the first rain. The track these prints and place was not a easy track for it was slightly up the debris pile and a fairly steep angle  my best guess why it would take this track was because the location of this place is in one of the few places in this area which has any open ground (not very large  but larger than the surrounding area) and as stated earlier it was right off one of the logging roads  so I guess he/it was walking along the bank to minimize his silhouette while treking along this open space next to the road. The next morning (Oct 20) we went back out there and we took some small sticks and placed hunters orange tape on the tops of the sticks then placed the sticks in the middle of the tracks so that we could get a visual on its track. We used one piece of tape to mark foot prints and used two pieces of tape to mark the hand print. This was so we could get a easier visual sight of what was going on. We then took the video camera and filmed the tracks and the track markers  so we have all this on video and you are welcome to view this  and in fact I can/will furnish a copy of the tape if interested in it. Just let us know if you wish to see it. ",Bigfoot
Report 65284: Campers awoken by loud knocks around 4am near Talemina Scenic Drive,[camp site near Horsethief Picnic Grounds off Talemina Scenic Drive],OK,Went camping in the Ouachita mountains near Talemina Scenic Drive.  At 3:39 we all woke up due to the sound of something knocking a tree behind us. Was in the distance but close enough to make you on edge. We thought it was a woodpecker and brushed it aside. 10 minutes later we heard the noise on our right side of the tent. The knocking was in triples such as “ knock  knock  knock” then a pause and the 3 knocks again  but in every direction the knocking had a slight variation. The knocking was coming from all sides of our tent  as if there was something surrounding us communicating. Knocks has slight variations in how quick they were  but all of them had the triple knocking. The closest knock was about 50 yard uphill from us. The close one made everything stop in the woods  it was raining and it stopped along with the wind. This is weird  considering it was super windy up there the whole time we stayed  except that one moment. We all agreed to not camp that spot again.,Bigfoot
Report 5817: Woman recalls childhood encounters.,it was about 3 miles east of hwy 84.  not too far from the mountain.  There was creek that ran through the pasture.,OK,"We were walking down the road enjoying our summer vacation.  When one of us noticed that there was something walking in the pasture North of where we were standing.  It was close to 7 feet tall  had long white hair (at least a foot)  was walking on two legs.  It stopped when it noticed us standing there watching it.  Actually we were almost too scared to run.  Anyway it acted like it was going to come our way so we took off for a little ways then stopped to look again.  Everyone knows that a fence with 6 strands of barbed wire is at least 5 feet tall right.  Well  it stepped over that like it wasn't there and kept on going to the East taking long strides and swinging its arms back and forth while it walked.  A few days later we were in the same general area and noticed some long white hair hooked on the top wire of the fence.  We took it home to prove our story we told the day before.  We called it a Honka.  Have to say that we were more careful about how late we stayed out from that day on.  Always made sure we were home before dark.  Until the moment we saw it we had heard lots of stories but never believed them.  Seeing is believing.  If you can talk to anyone in the Dustin area you will be told of several sightings of this nature and also will be told about what everyone called ""The Light""",Bigfoot
Report 26711: Couple witness a possible juvenile running on all fours in Smithville,,OK,We were on our way to a rental cabin (Cloud 9 cabins)  in Smithville Oklahoma on Oct 1  2009 on Beechton Road (dirt road) at about 4:30pm. The weather conditions were overcast  temp around 60  no rain  daylight  we were driving about 30 mph. No cars  houses  people for miles around. As we were heading to the west from Mena  Ak about a 1 ½ miles or so from the turnoff to the cabins  my wife Debbie smelled something sweet but dead smelling at the same time. About a minute after that  we went around a turn in the road  and saw an animal move across the road from the left to the right  into the brush and trees.  This animal moved in a very fluid motion on all fours. It was dark grey or black  short hair  about 36” long and about 24” high. It had no tail  no collar on its neck. The head was completely round about the size of a large grapefruit. There were also no ears or snout visible. It ran by moving its legs back and forth  not together as in how a cat would run fast. We could not identify it. We thought we might have seen a baby Sasquatch  going to its mother in the woods. We felt the mother might have crossed first  before we came to the curve. We do know what it was not. It was not a dog  cat  bear  bobcat  skunk  wolverine  rat  rabbit  skunk  or anything else that we have ever seen  and we do spend a lot of time in the woods  hunting and camping. The total time we saw the animal was about 3 seconds  and we stopped to look were it had entered into the woods  but saw nothing. What was more striking in my mind was  if it were to stand up. It would have looked like a small dark person. (keep in mind we didn’t see the face) We still think to this day that is/was a baby Sasquatch. When we got back home in Missouri  we looked on the internet for baby gorillas  to compare what they looked like to this animal  and there was a close match.,Bigfoot

The dogs were barking so I was curious to know what was going on outside. I saw the bushes moving and I saw what looked like a very tall   broad  stout  hairy person  almost ape looking  with long dark brown hair. It was rustling through the bushes. The leaves were moving. I looked at it for about two minutes trying to see what it was. Then it disappeared. I was describing what I had just seen to my sister on the phone as it happened. I felt excited and scared. I locked the door and checked for the twelve gage (my husbands gun). I didn't see the Sasquach after that. But once in a while after that  my dogs would bark in that different wimpering way. Not their normal bark. My sister was watching a documentary about Sasquatch in the Portland  OR area on the TLC Channel (The Learning Chanel) that aired on Friday  Oct. 27th 2000. That reminded her of our conversation on the phone when I saw Sasquach that day. She called me to talk about what I had seen because she did some research and found the bfro.net web site and encouraged me to document the sighting.,Bigfoot
Report 11304: Campers hear moaning howl at Waldo Lake at night.,This was one of the regular camping areas on Waldo Lake. I couldn't tell you the exact spot without going back to the area which I would be willing to do.,OR,While we were tent camping at Waldo Lake in the Oregon Cascades  at about 4 am we heard a moaning howl. My wife woke me up and said that there was a bear in the camp. I heard the howl and had no idea what kind of animal made that noise. Another camper a few hundred feet away had dogs that starting going crazy barking. The howling went on for about 20 minutes to a half hour. Our German shepherd started growling. We got up and got in the car with our sleeping bags still thinking it was a bear. At about 5 am and still dark  the other camper left in a hurry in his pickup. It looked like he lit about a half gallon of Coleman fuel in his fire pit. The flames were probably 6 feet tall. We did not see or hear anything else that night. The next day I walked around and looked for signs of the animal. I walked around the other camp and did not see anything. We joked about bigfoot coming that night but I was shocked this last year when I was listening to some of the bigfoot recordings on this site and then heard the moan howl from Columbiana  OH. That was exactly what we heard and it gave me chills.,Bigfoot

The sighting occured about 1/2-1/3 miles in.,OR,While sitting in the Blazer (with 3 other females ranging in age from 13-34 all of which were sleeping) that was broken down waiting for help to return I noticed on the east side that there seemed to be something peeking out from a tree aprox. 20' into the woods. I was thinking that it could have been a trick of lighting and the wind moving some branches as the only time I seemed to be seeing movement was when I was looking straight ahead to the north the direction the Blazer was headed and this was out of the corner of my right eye to the east and every time I would move my head to the right it would stop. I played this game for a while  but decided that if I was really seeing something  that I was going to have to turn my head to the right. I dozed off for a while and when I awoke I was still looking off to the right (east) and there was something peeking around a tree that was closer more like 15' or so  so I just kept my eyes on the object and was able to make out!that it was tall  hairy  light coloring in the face except for the eye and mouth area. It didn't move but just like a shifting of feet once in a while. It didn't advance any more  but seemed intent on watching what was going on or in seeing just what it was that it was looking at. I couldn't smell anything as the wind was blowing to the east. I didn't awake anyone because I didn't want to scare them. I didn't feel threatened  but I wasn't going to go and check it out either. At 3:30 help arrived and so I concentrated on what needed to be done to get the broken-down rig off the hill.,Bigfoot
Report 10928: Hikers hear growl  wood  knocking  have rock thrown at them.,McDonald-Dunn State forest  west on 99 north of Corvallis  near Peavy Arboretum.,OR,"While on a hike during this nice sunny day  I heard a low grumbling sound. My husband was leading me along the trail and he did not hear this sound. I stopped him and described the sound to him as a sort of ""wild boar"" type sound. It was VERY hard to describe. The sound was low  deep  like a vibrating growl or snort. We looked around and listened. When we didn't hear anything for quite a few minutes  we began walking again. Not more than 3 or 4 steps down the trail we hear a rustle noise and I quickly turned to see a rock or something rather large  dark and round fall to the ground with a large THUMP! The item had landed just where I was standing only a moment before. My husband heard this large item hit the ground and we stood stunned for a moment trying to figure out where it came from. I looked around the area and found a rock about the size of a baseball sitting where the item had hit the ground. My husband and I could NOT figure out where it had come from. Was a rock in the tree and it just now fell? Did something throw that rock at us? We were a bit jumpy but kept on down the trail. About 1/4 mile along the trail we hear a loud ""whomp  whomp"" like wood against wood sound ahead of us up on the hill. I asked my husband what that was and he decided it was probably just some people doing work on the trail. I didn't believe that's what it was. It sounded too heavy to be man made. Maybe machinery  but there was no motor sound and it was a Sunday evening. I doubt workers were on duty at this time and on this day. Just then we heard the sound move and we turned to hear the same wood on wood ""whomp"" noise behind us on the trail and still above us on the hill. My husband remarked  ""If that was bigfoot I don't know how he moved that quickly!"" I told him that we could rule out trail workers and that it was quite possible that it was TWO bigfoot communicating with each other. We joked about it  but we were both very shaken. We just could not come up with a more reasonable explanation for this sound. My husband describes this sound as a person hitting a tree quite hard with a large log. After yet another few minutes of looking around and hoping to see something  we walked along the trail without answers. After this we heard nothing more and came across several hikers on the last mile of the trail. Several hikers had dogs and we didn't hear any dogs going wild barking at anything unusual. My husband and I were going to stop some hikers to ask if they had heard anything  but we didn't want to look crazy or scare them away from the trail. Other than the rock being thrown at us we didn't feel as though we were in any kind of danger. When I got home I called my father who is quite familiar with forest animals and noises. He couldn't explain where the rock would have come from  but he believes that the wood on wood sound could possibly be deer or elk. I doubt that it was deer or elk just because the trail was so populated. They would have been spooked by the hikers and the dogs... besides  the ""whomp"" sound was SO heavy and SO loud that I can't imagine a deer making such a large sound. We didn't smell anything  we didn't see footprints...but I can't think of anything else that would explain these noises and the rock being thrown at us. I just really feel as though it could have been ""Bigfoot"".",Bigfoot
Report 9289: Elk hunter hears growl  finds footprints  feces.,The tracks were off the Maxwell Butte trail  I had been cutting cross country and would have to draw a map or show someone the exact location; my campsite was just up the road from the blacktop area  second camp site on left - sits across from large reprod.,OR,While I was archery hunting on Aug 31  2004 near Maxwell Butte  I found two tracks that measured 14x5 inches  both tracks had a prominent large toe on the side of the track. The tracks were not together but on the same ridge. I also found a feces pile that was like bear in contents (berry seeds) but much larger and more human-like.  it was like a fifty cent piece in diameter and 12-14 inches long. I had a visitor the next morning at 4 am. I was sitting in my dimly lit tent listening for elk bugling. I woke at 3 am and was wide awake drinking coffee and hoping to get a head start on my hunt by hearing elk. I was surprised by a low growl that sounded like it came from my stomach. I thought it was odd that I didn't feel it  but as soon as that thought crossed my mind a loud scraping sound was followed by a loud thud that came from the thick patch of trees next to my tent  only 2-3 feet away  I heard no other sound after that. I slapped the table top [inside the tent] hoping to hear something leave but whatever stomped the ground didn't make another sound. I put my boots on  grabbed an axe and went outside yelling  hoping to scare off the animal but I never heard another sound. I think a bear would have been more obvious. This animal was able to get next to my tent and leave without me noticing anything except for the growl and the stomp.,Bigfoot

It was getting dark so I started walking towards home. I entered the field to head up the hill  just then I saw a very dark figure ""crawling"" on the ground.  It reminded me of an alligator walking due to it wasn't using its rear legs.  Instead it was dragging them behind it while on its hands and stomach. I was unable to tell where it went from there  it had gotten very dark and I stayed put until my dad came looking for me with the tractor. I was too afraid to keep going due to fear. I remember it was hairy like an animal and appeared long in length. I went down the next day and seen where the drag marks were from it dragging its feet and where it seemed to get up and walk into the woods. Large footprints were still in the ground. Not sure anyone would believe me  I never told anyone. I was raised around all animals on the farm  been told what large animals were in the area. Never seen anything like it.",Bigfoot

I jumped up just in time to see a large brown figure going into the woods toward a stream behind my house. She said it ran from the neighbors down a powerline and was snapping off sumac like they were twigs.  Being young and curious I ran about 75 yds to the spot the animal had entered  there was a small drop off of about 20 feet then a level spot about 10 ft  then another 4 ft drop to the creek bed. When I arrived I observed the bigfoot at about 50 yrds  It must have heard me as it stopped and turned its upper torso and looked at me. The animal was between 6 and 7 ft tall with a dark face  after looking at me it made great strides down the creekbed and was gone around the bend. When my father arrived we went to check the area. There were very large heel prints in the top of the bank where the animal had landed when it leaped off of the top. I hunted those woods for years and there were times that I felt I was being watched  We heard vocalizations one night but my father said it was a bobcat  after hearing bigfoot recordings I believe they are what made the noise.,Bigfoot
Report 49903: Several possible incidents over the years in the Allegheny National Forest,Witness requested location be kept confidential.,PA,These incidents have occurred over a period of approximately 7 years. The occurrences have not been limited to a particular time of year. I have never  nor has any in our group  sighted a creature. Most have experienced hearing knocks  LOUD branch breaks  hearing bi-pedal footsteps emanating from a creature much larger than a human would make  smelled noxious odors  and had that inexplicable feeling of being watched. The place is a cabin which has been in my son-in-law’s family for 4 generations. It is located on the edge of the Allegheny National Forest  off the summit of a mountain. Across the lane from the cabin is a large meadow  belonging to a local doctor. This is sometimes planted in grain crops  other times allowed to remain fallow. There are other cabins scattered along the lane; none within eye-sight of the other. My first trip was in October of 2006. There was no other activity at the other camps. My son-in-law (Eric) and I arrived about 8-8:30 at night in the darkness. Upon exiting the Jeep  I had an immediate feeling of being watched. I have spent a good deal of time in the woods  hunting  fishing  and hiking. I am not easily spooked.  After dinner  cleaning up  and sitting up a bit talking we turned in about midnight. Around 2 A.M. I was awakened by the sound of the old wooden table and chairs being pushed about on the deck. We determined it must be a bear  and went back to sleep. Approximately 2 hours later we heard something rustling about the fire pit. We did NOT cook any food outdoors  we brought in all our empty bottles and such when we came in to discourage bears and other critters. In the morning  we found the table and chairs had been moved about  which a bear or even a large raccoon could have done. However  the fire pit had been scattered about  some of the smoldering logs rolled aside. Another time  we were hunting in the forest behind the cabin. The topography is typical Appalachian mountain; rugged  steep slopes  ravines  small streams and bogs. Here and there are small oil seeps as well. We had just descended into a fairly open area which promised grouse. This was early November  crisp but not cold. We were each carrying shotguns loaded with upland game shells. We were walking approximately 50 yards apart when we stopped  looked at one another and asked “What is that smell?” From out of no-where came the most putrid  overpowering smell. It was not the oil-seeps  which have their own sulfur like smell. This was horrid! It was like a skunk on steroids  with a good measure of open septic tank  and some rotten garbage added for good measure.  We continued on our way  the smell dissipated after about 100 feet.  We tried to tell one another it was a dead deer or something; but we both knew better. I worked in a funeral home while in college; and have never experienced anything that nauseating.   We also had an unnerving feeling of being watched the entire time we were there. Upon relating the above to my daughter  Eric’s wife  she stated she has smelled awful odors for no apparent reason as well and felt like she was being watched several times. We have heard howls  far in the distance  and others within a quarter mile  or so of the cabin. There are coyotes in the area  yet these are much longer in duration  and have more range. Some start low  and rise toward nearly a falsetto pitch. Others have been more monotone yet will waver somewhat. Others will start low  and culminate in a scream. This is not a bob-cat  not a coyote  and all members of our party are accounted for. In March of 2014  a group of us went for Spring Opening. There were 5 of us there. As darkness set in  I decided to venture out to the open meadow to observe the Winter constellations. This is about 100 yards from the cabin. The cabin is situated on the downward slope from the summit  which is the meadow. The area behind and on both sides of the cabin is a fairly steep slope. It is heavily grown with second growth trees  brush  and scrub. There are also a lot of blow-down branches which makes walking even in daylight difficult. At night  it is an invitation for a sprained ankle at best. As I was observing the stars and enjoying the silence  I heard footsteps. Not in the trail  not in the meadow  but coming UP the slope to the south of the cabin. My initial thought was a bear. As I listened  it was apparent the foot falls were from a biped. I called out if it was any of our group and received no reply. Then the steps would start again. I called again  louder  and the steps stopped for a moment.  Then  they began again  finally stopping by the edge of the lane. There were no lights showing  the moon was in the final phase of its final quarter  and just a sliver. I started to return to the cabin. I was about 20 yards from where I heard the steps stop along the edge of the lane. As I drew parallel to that area  I heard shuffling of the underbrush  as if whatever it was had turned it’s entire body sideways to watch me pass. When I entered the cabin  everyone was where I had left them. There were no new leafs  mud or debris in the doorway. When I asked if they heard anything  they all said no  as they were watching Planes  Trains and Automobiles on VHS. Finally  this past Spring  a group of us went up for a weekend. While sitting about the rear deck  enjoying a fire and talking  a member of our party was encouraged to do their howl. They did. Then about 30 seconds later  the sound of a very large tree limb snapping came from down the slope behind the cabin. Could it have been a bear stepping on a branch? Perhaps  but that would be very coincidental to step on a limb just after a howl. I KNOW there is something in those mountains. I can’t prove it physically; it one of those things that you know that you know. Please keep this location undisclosed. We would hate to see a bunch of people go hunting for these creatures. They don’t deserve to be pursued and bothered. I have been needing to share this with someone who won't think I am off my rocker. Thank you.,Bigfoot
Report 6496: Bicycling student has night encounter,Great swamp area  Narragansett Indians,RI,"While attending U.R.I in the Fall of 1974 I would stay at my girlfriends mother's house on weekends because I only had a five day mealbook plan. It was Sunday evening about 10:00pm when I decided to head back to school on my ten speed bike. Very dark in the area because it being mostly wooded  country like setting but yet city. I was going down her street and noticed my front center pull brake needed to be adjusted. I stopped under a street light at the end of her street which is an intersection to adjust the brake. Directly in front of me was a small field that sloped down and away from me pitch black background  tall grass and a few bushes being light by the street light. Typical New England  Oak  Maple and  Pine trees. As I was fixing my brake I began hearing very loud foot steps of a biped  comig from the field on the slope side more like a crushing thud. I could hear the actual compression being placed  like someone dropping a heavy metal ball/rock on the ground.I looked up to see if I could see anything and just said to myself ""its nothing""  and went back to fixing my brake. I noticed it was getting closer and felt very apprehensive  the sound was coming in my direction. All of sudden this dog starts barking like crazy  I can hear the chain snap as it either tries to attack or getaway from something. I said to myself ""its time to go!""  as I started I turned left to head north  into a few pedals. From out of the darkness steps into the street light this white looking gorilla. The legs present themselves then the body as it comes to rest on its knuckles. Twenty maybe twenty five feet away  directly across the street from me perhads six feet tall maybe 400 pounds or more. Massive arms that went straight down on its knuckles  knees slight bent.The head is higher in the back connected to the neck all-in-one mass. The face dark  deep strong  but primate.The eyes are close together and set deep in the face. The nose and mouth are human like  it's nose is wide  around the mouth black hair that went down on each side.It looks up with its head and chest see me  eyeball to eyeball as I look back trying to see if this thing is real. Humanlike in appearance  the face is not like a primate but has a distinct animal presence (the eye are close together). I was never so scared in my life and knew had I stayed I don't think I would of survived the attack.The way it was positioned gave it an explosive start as it decides to chase me down the street. My heart was pounding out of my chest  my eyes had tears in them and with all my might I pedaled as it ran on two legs  then down on its knuckles then back up again. Perhaps for ten yards  I remember how its long hair on its arms moved with each reach I thank god I was in first gear. A good five second chase and it was all over.It had stopped in the middle of the street just swaying back and forth  turned and just cleared this rock wall all in one motion from a grass sidewalk. At the top of hill I began riding in circles  I didn't know what to do  I could not comprehend the situation I was in. I knew one thing I was not riding back. I cut through her grandmother's yards and made it back to her house. Not trying to look crazy or anything they ask me what's wrong ? I told them what happened and agreed  that it was best to go back in the morning.",Bigfoot
Report 15923: Daylight sighting by mountain biker in Black Hut Management Area outside Glendale,From route 102 N or S. Take Spring Lake Road. Follow there are multiple points of entry in to the reserve and a general parking lot at the end of Spring Lake Road.,RI,"The exact date was October 15  1998. I was training for a mountain bike race and this was to be my last ride prior to the race. I was riding at the Black Hut Management Area in Glendale RI. Along for the ride was my three year old mixed breed (shepard/lab)large dog. It was sunny but cool and I planned to spend an hour or so breaking a swet. As i weaved my way through the trails  i had to leash my dog to cross a street. After I unhooked him we started up a hill toward a chasam. It's small and kids hang around there and drink beer  have fires etc. At the crest of the hill I could see the top of the chasam (approx. 50 yards away). Out of the corner of my eye I noticed something that first appeared to be a dirty white blanket perhaps hung on a small tree. Suddenly (I think it heard us)it turned (as it was squatting with it's back to me)saw me stood up and disapeared into the woods. I was shocked and could not believe what I had just saw. From my vantage point I would say the animal was white or grey but very dirty. In no way did it resemble a man. I did not see the face clearly. But from what I did see (full rear view) although it stood fairly erect  it's gate and posture was like an ape. The arms were not long like a gorilla and oddly it was no were near seven-feet tall. I'd estimate maybe six feet at best. I reversed my direction and rode immediately to the top of the chasam. I looked for footprints and hair but didn't find any. I walked a short distance in the woods in the direction were it disapeared. My heart was pounding so loud I could hear it. I knew it was no were in the general area because my dog was not barking. Anytime there is an animal near fox  coyote  deer  my dog barks and will usally chase. Interesting point is that my dog never barked and I don't think he saw  heard or smelled it. I noticed no unusual smell in the area. And also noted no signs of broken branches and no way to determine its direction. I've told one or two people and in November of 1998 a friend and I (with video and digital camera) spent two weekends hiking in the area directly behind the chasam with no results. I also snow shoed the area after the first snow. I was starting to believe I had imagined it. In 2002 I met a hunter in a bar and asked him if he ever hunted at Black Hut. He said ""yes""  ""and once I saw a white gorilla there! I had chills and related my story. The differences were in color  he stated white (the one i saw was more grey) and said the one he saw was eight feet tall. Still  same place same type of sighting. What made me write this is the two other RI sightings seem to be similar. I wish I could have seen it longer and closer. ",Bigfoot
Report 6643: Mother and son see sasquatch closeup from road,In a development off RT 112 in Charlestown known as Five Seasons.,RI,"I've told very few people this story for fear that they might think I'm crazy. The only reason why I'm taking the time to report this is because of a recent entry a friend of mine who knew my story told me about. My story takes place in Charlestown  Rhode Island in the late 1970's. My mother and father and I lived in a wooded area abutting the ""Indian Cedar Swamp"" and property owned by United Nuclear which probably comprises several thousand acres. The property surrounding our home was mixed  white Atlantic juniper swamp scarlet  red and white oaks with old growth white pine stands mixed in  with a dense understory of briars  mountain laurel and blue berry brush. We lived off a road with 3 houses on it. The houses were all built close to the entrance of this development. The road was part of a series of roads that were put in as the start of a development. The roads were oiled gravel and had been left to grow in after years of little or no use. It looked like the developer had started and went belly-up. These roads were great to ride bikes on or take a evening cruise on after bringing my father dinner at his second job. My mother drove a baby blue Mustang Mach 1 and she would drive around the roads with me looking at deer before we retired to our home for the evening. As a kid I remember this being a highlight to the evening. I was at the time maybe 8 years old and my mother and I on this particular night in the late 70's commenced our ride around the roads to see if we sould see any deer. It had been raining earlier with thunder and lightning mixed in. Now it was just raining. We were rounding a corner on one of the roads that paralleled the Indian Cedar Swamp and as we started downward   we noticed the road was obstructed by a large blown down oak tree  the tree had green leaves (this makes me think it was summer or the early fall) on it so it had recently come down  we guessed maybe in the storm earlier(possibly lightning). The road was very narrow and the brush along the side of the road made it difficult to back the car around to turn around. The rain was falling but not heavy  the wipers were on  the headlights on the car were on as well. As my mother turned the front end  of the car the lights cast on the left side of the road where the tree had been broken off from its stump. We were maybe 1 1/2 car lengths from the stump. Beside the tall fractured stump stood what looked like a large white(yellow white) ape. It was maybe 6 to 7 feet tall  its hair was long  face flat  long massive arms  its head appeared to be without any neck  its chest was broad. My mother and I froze momentarily (5 seconds  maybe 10) and the figure remained still  staring at us. My mother floored the car into reverse. I remember ther terror of it all. The sound of gravel hitting inside the fender wells  the sound of the brush crushing against the car and then the acceleration as she sped off. We were clear as to what we saw and we have no question in our mind that we saw something or someone in ape like shape that night. This we are certain of. We need no one to tall us what we saw  it's crystal clear. For years we told no one. We would talk about it in our home in privacy and even my father found this story hard to accept. We've never forgotten this and this story would have never been told if it wasn't for someone else informing me of a similar sigthing. I'm now in my 30's an extremely active hunter  farmer and woodsman. I hunt deer 40 days a year in Maine  RI  CT and New Jersey. I use automated cameras which are triggered by heat. I've never seen a picture of a bigfoot on my film. I have seen pictures of deer on my 50 acre tract of land that I would never believe are there if I didn't see it on my film. I know every inch of my land and the surrounding property and these mystery deer show up at all hours on my cameras and frequently at that. How can they move right around our hunting parties in such a small area and never be seen  I'll never know  Even today I find it hard to accept what we definitely saw. I'm not a fan of ghosts  UFO's or even big foot. I'm not sure to this day what I saw wasn't a man in a costume  dressed up  out in rainstorm  a half mile or more from any home  waiting for my mother and me to drive down the road to give us a scare. The only thing I can say is it was a damn' good costume and a damn' good plan. We saw what we saw and this is something I would sware to on any polygraph test as I'm sure my mother would.",Bigfoot
Report 30906: Early morning sighting by a motorist along Route 6 near Foster,Route 6 East going from CT into RI,RI,I was driving along Route 6 crossing the CT state line into RI.  The road is very dark and heavily wooded in this particular area.  As I was traveling east  something quickly moved across the road in front of me.  I was driving approximately 55 mph.  Once I registered what I was seeing I also realized that whatever it was  it had walked on two legs.  It cleared the guardrail on the side of the road in one step and was gone.  I was very spooked.  The whole incident lasted less than 30 seconds  though I think about it often.  especially when I drive through that area.,Bigfoot
Report 16746: Possible stick formation found by hiker in the Great Swamp,From I-95 S  merge onto RI-4 S toward North Kingstown. Take exit 5B to Exeter and continue on Ten Rod Rd. Turn left at S County Trl. Left at Kingstown Rd. Right at Watson Rd. Right at Liberty Ln. Then left at Great Neck Rd.,RI,I have recently become very interested in bigfoot research  and based on reports that I found on this website of previous incidents in the area  decided to go to Great Swamp in Rhode Island to look for any evidence of bigfoot. After walking thirty to forty minutes down the main trail beginning from Great Neck Road  I took a smaller path off of the trail for about five minutes. That is when I noticed a young tree that was snapped in half at about six feet off the ground. More noteworthy  however  was a stick formation that I found a little bit farther down the path on a slightly elevated area of land. It was small  maybe three feet high  but constructed in the same woven-looking manner characteristic of other possible bigfoot stick formations. Other than that  I did not find anything else unusual. It may not be extremely compelling evidence  but I figured it was worth telling experts  who could then take it as far as they saw fit.,Bigfoot

Report 23314: Late night roadside sighting by motorist on Hwy. 917 south of Mullins,The location of the incident was just past the Little Pee Dee River on Hwy 917 between Marion and Mullns  SC,SC,The year was 1998  September.  I was in the Air Force  stationed in Sumter  SC (Shaw AFB) and was traveling home to N. Myrtle Beach  SC with my two young sons (7 and 5)--they were asleep in the back seat.  I had worked that day and had spent time with my neighborhood friends after work.  I was a single parent and my children hated to ride in the car  so I had intentially started my trip very late--about 11pm.  Trip was pretty much uneventful (as always) until about 1am.  As I was traveling one of the many shortcuts I had found (hwy 917) and just passed the Little Pee Dee River  I noticed what I thought was a dog in a ditch.  As I approached  the animal turned and looked at the car and I immediately knew that this was no dog.  It was stooped over in the ditch  maybe eating a deer carcass or some other road kill.  When it turned there was a couple of things that I noticed first...  It's face almost looked like an orangutan's  there was no fur on the face and it had lips that had no real shape to them  the mouth was wider than a man's  the lips were pursed together and very narrow.  It's head seem to be wider than normal with scraggely fur on top.  The fur had an orange-brown tint to it (thus the thought that it was a dog).  It was in the process of standing straight up when it turned to look at me  almost picking itself up in the process.  Therefore  I know that it was not an animal that I had ever seen before.  I did NOT get a chance to look at it in it's full length since I passed and could not see it in the mirror.  It did not appear to have a neck  and was much broader in the shoulder and chest area than it initially appeared.  Again  I did not notice much about the legs since I did not see much of them--I will say that the chest was MUCH larger than the mid (and butt) section and it never turned fully around--but what I did notice was the arms.  They were very long and what appeared to be fingers were curved up into it's palms (not a fist)--therefore  making me believe it was some sort of ape--that maybe it mostly walked on all fours like a chimpanzee). It was covered from head to toe (with exception to the already mentioned facial area in the orange-brown fur...It had two apparent arms  I never really saw the legs since they were underneath the animal and hidden by the ditch and was much larger than I had initially thought.  The ditch was probably 3 to 4 feet deep and the animal (stooped or bent over) rose above the ditch about 4 to 5 more feet.  Another reason why the dog scenario did not fit the bill.  The reason I knew the animal was stooped or bent over was because when it turned to look at me  it had to push itself up out of the ditch with it's arms (hands  I assume) and turn around--it was initially facing in the direction I was driving (SSE) and was apparently standing  still slightly stooped over  when I passed.  It was a very dark night and I could only see the animal with the headlights.  I was driving about 65 and when I saw the animal  I slowed down--thought it was going to run out in front of me--I had deer do that to me before... When I passed I looked in the mirror  but it was too dark to make any discernable shape in the ditch.  I certainly did not stop as I was sort of tripped out and I had my two young sons in the car with me.  I retired from the Air Force in 2007 and have only told a very few people this story thinking they would believe I was crazy! I live in Texas now and have never seen another thing like that.  I am looking for any explanation that you may have for this.  I have perused your website  as well as others  and have not found any in the area that I had my sighting.  Any explanation would be greatly appreciated.,Bigfoot
Report 12205: Late night sighting by motorists near GA/SC border,On rte 321 toward rte 301  near the SC/GA border,SC,On July 9th we were driving from NYC through the Carolinas for a vacation with family members. While driving on 95 I missed my exit and continued on 95 til south of the border. We weren't sure if we missed our exit so we got off the highway and went to a gas station to ask for directions. I was told to take Rte 301 off 95. This is in South Carolina. While on 301  about 10 minutes into it  I was driving at about 70-75 miles an hour when out of the dark  a black  hairy  tall thing crossed the road in front of us. It was not a bear.  It stood like a person with a slight bent. It had hair all over its body. I had to turn the wheel to the left to avoid hitting this thing.  It almost hit the right side of my van. The screams inside my car were frightening. We almost lost control of our car. I saw it  so did my wife  2 aunts and my 7 seven year old granddaughter.

I began smelling a strange smell that I had never smelled before on a birdfarm. I began shining my Q-beam spotlight around in the darkness. I noticed something standing behind the barn across from me. I could see the animal picking up acorns or something off the ground.The animal didn't like my spotlight because it would block the light with its hand. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I ran over to my coworker  that was working on the other feed truck to warn him as to what I had seen. He laughed and said for me to quit tryin to scare him. I told him that I was serious  and he would see it if it was still there  since it was behind the last barn that he had to pump feed in. I noticed he was startled when he shined his spotlight and saw this large creature for himself. He claimed that this creature started walking toward him  and it really shook him up  because he ran to the front of his truck and sped to the front of the farm where I waited on him. He was white as a ghost. He claimed that this creature was between 8 to 10Ft. in height and as broad as two linebackers. I told him that's exactly what I had seen .,Bigfoot
Report 24235: Man recounts watching a sasquatch cross road near Cross Anchor,,SC,In 1991  I don't remember the exact date  my wife  then girlfriend  and I were riding around the backroads of Cross Anchor trying to see any deer crossing or standing on the side of the road. This was our typical date  all you redneck country boys will understand. I don't remember the name of the road we were on but it was between hwy.49 and hwy.72  not far from ridge rd. back toward Clinton. It was around 1 or 2 in the morning. We were going down this road and way out in front of us  out to the point where the headlights barely reach  we saw something cross the road on two legs. I punched the gas and sped up to try to get down there so maybe we could see what it was. When we got to the area where it crossed I stopped and rolled the window down and was shining my mag light in the woods. Back about maybe twenty yards in the woods I noticed this tree that had a big lump on the side of it. Well  I focused my light on that tree for a few seconds just looking when all of sudden this thing stepped out  looked right at us then turned and walked on into the woods out of sight. At that point I didn't know what to do. My wife was yelling for me to get out of there so I hit the gas and drove off. Being dark as it was  it's hard to say just how big it was but I would guess around 7 feet tall. It looked to be covered in brownish hair all over. I'm not sure about the face  I couldn't see it that good. The only reason I knew it was looking at us was because it's eyes were glowing red from the flashlight. I've hunted that area for years  and I've heard a lot of unusual things but that was the only time I ever seen anything like that.,Bigfoot
Report 65588: Possible howls heard 4 miles north of Rochford in middle of Black Hills,Approximately 4 mi north of Rochford  at Carsten’s Cottages,SD,I was visiting my family’s former home and treated myself with a night’s stay at the cottages. They lie along the road running through from Deadwood to Rochford. The campground was empty save for me  even the proprietor was not home. They have beautiful pastures and a huge assortment of farm life - from turkeys to quail to goats and llamas donkeys and horses.  Their fields run right up to the forest  probably not even a football fields length away. I was sitting outside watching their antics and enjoying the evening air.  Suddenly  something started to howl in the woods to the west. Everything alive on the place froze in that same moment and all of their heads - mine included- swiveled toward the sound. I cannot begin to describe it  but I had grown up in these hills and know it was nothing I could identify.  The sound was somewhere between a howl and a scream and just echoed. It went on for 3-5 minutes  and every creature stopped to listen. I didn’t hear it again while there. I didn’t tell the proprietor when I saw him next. Since then  I’ve listened to recordings to try and identify the sound and the recent recording by the hunter out of Canada is an exact match. That’s what impelled me to report it.,Bigfoot

Report 25415: Possible nighttime visit while camping in the Black Hills of South Dakota,Take Hwy 14A west out of Sturgis,SD,"I travel  every year on vacation  to South Dakota to do some camping in the Black Hills and have for the past three years camped in the same location. I belong to a club of outdoor enthusiasts  we travel to certain locations to scratch a living from the earth for a few days and once you have the fever there's no such thing as a nonworking vacation. This last trip (June 2008) I had an experience I couldn't explain: I was asleep in my tent; I was the only person left in camp everyone else had packed up and left. I wasn't too concerned as I have camped by myself in this area several times and could only recall one other time when I felt like something was nearby perhaps a cougar or other predator type animal as the crickets stopped chirping and the whole area became extremely quiet. This particular night I was sleeping soundly and was then suddenly awake and aware that something was up  everthing was silent. I didn't know what had woken me at first but I reached over and checked my watch seeing that it was 3:11am I thought to myself I need to get back to sleep  then I heard it; someone or something was moving around in the stream below my camp. Not directly below  but more to the north and west of my camp following the curvature of the stream. Picture a curving ""L"" shape. Now rotate the ""L"" 1/4 turn to the right  apply that to moving stream water  my camp sits above the water 20 to 30 feet in the inside turn of the ""L"". I heard splashing in the stream and then  SMACK....SMACK. There was a pause of a few seconds then SMACK....SMACK....SMACK. It was two rocks being hit together in a pattern. Ok  creepy and not what I was expecting  I reached over and put a shell in the chamber of my weapon and checked the safety. I'll give it a few minutes and if nothing else happens I'll go back to sleep. Nothing else did happen except when the sun came up I packed up and left. The area around the stream is covered in rocks of every size and shape from small pebbles to boulders as big as cars and trucks. I didn't think to look for tracks. I was still the only one there and I didn't know what to think  except that if someone thought it was fun to show up at a secluded camp at that time of night to smack rocks together there must be something wrong with them and it's time to vacate the area.  A few months later I saw a program on primates and how they will knock rocks and sticks together to communicate I put two and two together and realized I may have had an encounter.",Bigfoot

But the last time was very intence  I was walking home from town (about 3 miles away)and it was pretty dark so I was looking down most of the time. I was about a quarter of a mile from home and I turned onto the street that led to my house. I walked about 30 feet and there it was. It was about 10 feet in front of me. It was down on it's hands and feet doing something! It saw me at the same time I saw it  it stood up and we looked at each other for a few seconds (it seemed like forever) then it ran one way and I ran the other way. Now we always called it the White Thing. It looked like what most people think a big foot looks like except it is an off white color  it is about 8-9 feet tall.

Report 10220: Motorists have nighttime sighting near Pulaski.,Not sure exactly where on US 64 - somewhere between Pulaski and Fayetteville. There were woods to the right of the car where a bigfoot was running. We were traveling east on US 64.,TN,We were in the car heading back home (probably around 10:00 pm) when the sighting occurred. We were traveling east down US 64. There were high winds and my dad had trouble keeping the car on the road. We were driving along when we spotted something run across the road in front of us. It appeared to look like a bear  only more human features  but the rate at which it ran across the road made us believe it could not have been a bear. My dad (who has since passed away in 2002) and I are the only ones in the car who were able to spot what we believe was a bigfoot. My mother was in the car and looked down for a moment and missed what we saw. It happened so fast. The one thing I can remember is the bigfoot was searching for shelter quickly with the storm approaching. I could see that the bigfoot was fearful of the storm and was looking for shelter. It was one of the most unbelievable things I have ever witnessed. I have shared my story with friends and family for years. I believe I saw a bigfoot in the flesh to this day. It was amazing!,Bigfoot
Report 11682: Young men have frightening vocalization incident near Stones River.,,TN,Upon my initial encounter  I did not think at all that I would be attributing it to something like this. However  the more I read  the more certain I am that me and my friends had a close encounter with a bigfoot. It was early spring when me and two buddies decided to romp through the woods behind my dad's house. It was just before dusk and there was an hour or so left of daylight. We headed out equipped with only two flashlights and cigarettes. My friends were Robert (a tall well built guy and Paul  another large guy but not as tall as Robert). Neither of them had any beliefs in anything other than the normal mundane. I on the other hand have always had an open mind on topics such as these. We were prompted to venture out based on some local tales of the woods that grew up to my dad's back yard and that encompassed many miles of land along the Stones River in TN. The stories were mostly odd noises (growling  knocking sounds  and screams). The occasional sighting of something strange (figures moving through the woods etc). We always thought it to be ghosts as battles of the Civil War were fought in the area. Anyway  we set out to explore the woods and the horse trail that followed the river several hundred yards behind the house. As we reached the trail I noticed oddly that there seemed to be quite a few trees that had been pushed over and uprooted. I commented on this to them and they didn't seem to think much of it. We continued on and at a fork in the trail we opted for the higher ground as the alternative path was somewhat muddy. This lead us to a ravine that the trail sharply bypasses. On a whim I offered up the idea that we should get off the trail and hike out this ravine to see where it would lead. They both pondered for a moment and off we went. Perhaps an hour or two went by with us all having a great time laughing and conversing when we came upon a spot of ground that was covered with dried grass and chose to take a break. At this point it was well past dark. We shut off our lights and Robert and Paul lit up their cigarretes. I remember looking up while they smoked and seeing stars but no moon. It was crystal clear and I commented on how dark it was. A few moments passed and Robert then seemed to become uneasy and stated that he was ready to head back. Paul and myself seemed a little thrown off by this as we have never seen Robert become so unnerved so quickly. We readily agreed to leave and rose from our spot on the ground and realized that where we were sitting was just 5' from the trail. We climbed the steep embankment and resumed our walk on the trail. The trail follows the river and if you walk far enough it meets the road and curves sharply back into the woods and continues on with the river for many miles. I have never (especially after that night) walked it's entire length. In fact  I can't recall anyone I know that has. Regardless as we started walking I did get the sensation that we were being watched. I think we all 3 had this feeling as our conversation and laughter didn't ever quite resume. We had walked about 15-20 yards perhaps after climbing back onto the trail (which at this point had no trees overhead just on each side of us) and then the trail entered into the woods again. The forest here was extremely thick overhead and it was very dark at this point. We continued on with the intentions of getting to the road as mentioned before. We were perhaps 100 yards from the road when we heard the first branch break. If you asked me today I would tell you that Paul was a little crazy as he darted into the woods in the direction of the noise. He had no flashlight as Robert and myself had the only 2. At this moment I have never seen someone so afraid as Robert was at that moment. He was more than willing to leave our idiot friend and bolt for the road. After some convincing  we headed toward the location Paul had run. We used our flashlights sparingly as we had assumed by now that someone was out there with us. We did not want out lights to give away our location. I remember nearing the point where Paul vanished and calling his name in a half yell/whisper. His reponse still gives me chills. He half pleading asked me to be quiet. Then I heard him making his way toward us. When he entered onto the trail from the trees on our right side I could see his face (barely but enough) was filled with fear. He told us that someone was out here and that now he too was more than ready to leave. We quickly stood up and turned to make our way to the nearest exit... to the road when we heard again another branch break. This was in the direction we were wanting to go. Not what we wanted to hear. At this point  I feel it's necessary to point out that when I say branches breaking I don't mean little twigs. It was loud enough to sound like someone snapping a rather large branch on their knee. To me it meant something big. With no option to leave quickly we opted to head back the way we had come. I would guess that we had walked maybe 2-3 miles away from my home. None of us looked forward to this prospect  least of all Robert. At a brisk pace we began the hike back with our lights on. This is where the story begins to blur and again I get chills thinking about it. Whatever it was had to be following us for from time to time  we would hear the same branch breaking. Each time we did  we would crouch down and huddle together with our lights off. Then  when all seemed well  we would trek off again lights blazing. I would say this pattern repeated perhaps 5-6 times. The last time we huddled is the last moment of clarity I have. We were at the base of a fairly steep incline on the trail. Along the river this was an area we called the bluffs as there are a series of steep cliffs here. We cut off ourlights again in response to the same noises. We had not huddled for more than 30 seconds when the air was filled with the most horrific scream I have ever heard in my life. The intensity was such that it echoed far down the river and I would have to say for several miles. Without hesitation I ran. I know they did too as I could hear Robert and Paul behind me. We did not stop and did not turn off our lights till we reached the house. Fully out of breath  we all three collapsed in the living room. We were all in disbelief unsure as to what had just happened. I heard my dog begin to bark and assumed that she was barking at us returning home. She was kept in a fenced in area out back. Paul took a light and shone it into the yard and quickly noted that she was barking into the woods. When he closed the back door  we heard the scream again. It had followed us for the most part but remained in the woods. Having enough  we left. I spent the night at their house not eager to remain home. There are several other things I would like to report that have only now dawned on me that relate to this experience and this topic. Also  I would love the chance to have someone with knowledge accompany me to the area as I do not think this was an isolated encounter. (Added some of these notes below),Bigfoot
Report 10591: Predator caller has night time encounter in Sam Houston National Forest,Creeks and ponds in the area.,TX,"While predator calling this date  I was targeting bobcats with an electronic call. (I mention this because with this particular call  only a bobcat would be expected to respond. A fox  coyote  coon  etc. would not respond to this call.) After about 10 minutes of calling  I heard a sound from behind me that I could not identify. I was using a varmint light  which has a red filter. This light is not normally readily seen by predators. I shined the light toward the sound  and saw what I thought was a bear. It was dark in color  but everything was either light or dark because of the red filter. I have hunted in the West several times  and seen many bears. I initially thought that's what this was. But as stated earlier  a predator does not respond (normally) to this light. But this animal did. It stood up and moved away very rapidly on it's two ""hind"" legs. While on all fours  it appeared to be a bear. Upright  it appeared to be around 5-foot tall with a fairly large stride. I wasn't able to notice any other details because of the light source and because of how quickly it moved off. Bears do not move great distances on their hind legs  and especially not rapidly. It made this sound continuously as it moved away  gradually decreasing in volume until I couldn't hear it any longer.  I'm not sure what this was  but I'm quite certain what it was not  and it was not a bear  a hog  or any other animal native to this area. After a recent conversation with Daryl Colyer  he and Craig Woolheater encouraged me to make this report. I did not do so earlier because I simply had no idea there was a possiblilty this could have been a bigfoot-type animal. Should there be any follow-up  I'd like to request Daryl Colyer as the investigator.",Bigfoot

I don't know how but we ended up by the main road called River Rd  leading to the campsite. we could just make out the small light of the main office. That road is dark and there were no cars that night for some reason. Well  we were walking along the side of the road where the tree line was by the Guadalupe River. When we started hearing footfalls behind us  very heavy footfalls. The only thing  they were coming from the other side of the road where the sheer rock cliff is  intermingled with a thin tree line. They were not pranksters like someone already suggested to me. The air that night was weeping (meaning humid). Suddenly we stopped and what ever it was stopped too  but when it stopped it must have stepped on a branch because we heard the branch break. Well needless to say we ran the hell out of there all the way back to the camp. My wife was so frightened we had to leave the secound it got light.,Bigfoot

Report 38797: Woman recalls childhood experience of a terrifying night-time encounter while camping near Kennecott Copper mine,Butterfield Canyon Road below Kennicott Copper Mine,UT,When I was a child before bigfoot was known to me  we went on a family camping trip in Butterfield Canyon in the Oquirrh mountains below Kennecott Copper Mine. There were six people there. Two adults and four children. The tent was pitched by the creek next to a trail. Tent was tall enough to give the adults a couple feet of head room. When we were in the tent getting ready to make our beds (it was thundering with alot of lightning) we smelled the worse smell. It made our eyes water and our noses run  it was that bad. Next we could hear a large animal coming up to the tent. It was screaming and yelling. When it got to the tent it stood over the top of the tent. Our bodies were vibrating from the screams  our noses and eyes were running from the smell. When the lightning would go off we could see the shadow of long hair hanging down from massive arms. This thing towered over the tent as we were all ready to die from the fear. The adult male that was with us went out of the tent to do something. We had never heard of Bigfoot and he wanted to protect us. When he came back in the tent (after we heard scuffling and growling outside) he sat down with his back on the tent's zipper. His face was white and his eyes were huge with fear. First bit of daylight he had us packed and out of there. Years later he told my granddaughter that he confronted Bigfoot that night and could never get over it. He would never tell us that was there  what he saw. We knew it had to be nine feet tall at least to hover over the tent. There are three witness left that cant get over it.,Bigfoot

Report 20430: Possible camp stalking at Betsy Lake  Grandaddy Basin  Uinta Mountains,"We went around Strawberry reservoir (NE of Heber) Hwy 40 up to Hanna  then on a dirt road  then backpacked to Betsy Lake (Granddady Basin).  We were on the North side of the lake. It as a ""No firearms allowed""  area.",UT,"We backed pack into the Uintah's two years in a row - this was our second year. I have never shared my experience with anyone.  I was afraid people would think I'm crazy.  My personal experience happened about 1985-1986.  We were camping in the high Utah Uintah's (Grand-Daddy Basin) on the North edge of Betsy Lake  in a small clearing.  Since we were by the lake we built a little raft out of logs (tied them together).  The FIRST night something woke me (I was in a tent with my nephew).  It was about 2:00-3:00am I could feel and hear heavy walking outside the tent.  We had a two man tent and something was playing with the top of the tent (feeling the poles).  I lay in my sleeping bag (petrified!). Because we were so close to the water  I also heard someone (something) in the lake. What caught my attention the most was the long strides when they walked.  I knew it wasn't a bear  because bears would have clawed at the tents.  Whenever I camp  I always sleep in my clothes.  I finally got the courage to go out of the tent to look things over.  While I was putting on my shoes  my Nephew woke  and he said  ""What's that?!""  I said  ""I don't know  but I'm going out to find out.""  As I went out of the tent  I screamed as loud as I could (like Tarzan) to scare them away! The one in the lake came out and joined the other and they ran past the tents.  My sister heard them run past her tent and they ran fast!  They were gone immediately! The SECOND night I moved into the tent with my sister and her husband and my nephew moved into his sister's tent.  About the same time of the night  I heard them again.  I just lay in my sleeping bag wondering if I was crazy.  I could hear them walking around and I listened extra hard to recognize how large they must have been from the extra heavy footsteps and very long strides.  They hung around for several hours (moving around) and left at day break. The THIRD night they came about the same time.  I could hear them walking around again  and then one of them grabbed the tent rope and plunked it (""Bing"" like a guitar string).  My head was about 6""-8"" from the side of the tent and suddenly one of them ran their fingers across the side of the tent (that's how it sounded to me).  With my heart pounding and everyone awake  I stepped out of the tent to build a fire (hoping this would scare them off).  While I was building the fire  I could feel them watching me.  When the fire became a blaze they walked off (they didn't run this time).  Later in the day we went out on the raft.  As I looked into the water  I pointed and said ""Footprints""!!  My brother in law laughed at me  but what I saw were large dips as if something had walked into and out of the water.  It was about the same place I heard something come out of the water the first night.  My brother in law teased me about my ""big Foot"" experience.  Since my brother in law is a heavy sleeper and snores loud  I have wondered if the sound of his snoring is what brought them to our tents. .",Bigfoot
Report 25233: Bowhunter recalls hearing possible intimidation at night while returning to camp in Farmington Canyon,,UT,"This story that you are about to read has a lot of similarities to some stories you might have already read. It was in August of 1977. It happened on a hunting expedition in Farmington Canyon  Utah. There were four in the hunting party. Everyone was away from camp hunting. There are two lakes where this occurred. The sun began to go down to set. It was an archery hunt so normally you would sit wherever you were because that's when the deer or the elk come out. Every hunter's hopes are that he is going to see something before it gets dark. On this particular evening  nothing seemed to come out from the landscape. So I proceeded to move slowly back down the trail towards camp  which was set up just below the lakes. It was to dark now to see any of my other hunting companions. No moon was in the sky  just stars. I had positioned my self above the upper lake. I knew the area quite well. As I proceeded to go back  I had to cross a little creek that came out through a marsh below the upper lake. But being that it was dark  I couldn't really see the trail. But I could hear the water gurgling in front of me. As I came to this spot in the trail I new I had to make the right moves or I would end up in the water. I sat there trying to adjust my eyes to see where to make the next step. While I was standing there for a few seconds  I started to hear a low growling noise. I have never heard a noise like this. I never believed in Bigfoot. When I heard the noise I thought it was one of my companions playing with my mind hiding in the bushes. So I not very loudly muttered under my breath  ""Steve...Mike....is that you?"" Not getting any answer I could hear the trees start to thrash and that noise came back again with a deeper growl  almost like a moan  low in pitch. As I stood there it seemed like an eternity but was only about five minutes. I knew I had to be making a move. I had to take that trail that lead through the bushes. With my bow in one hand I held my breath and jumped to big leaps across the creek  landed half in the water and yelled out a couple of loud words and ran through those bushes. I never stopped until I reached camp. When I got back to camp. There was nobody there. So I put my bow against the tree and proceeded to get a flashlight out of the tent. Within a few minutes everyone was back at camp. We all talked about what we had seen and what we had heard. Then I talked about what I had seen and what I had heard and everyone had a hard time believing my story. They thought I probably heard a cougar. But I have been hunting for many years and I know a cougar when I hear one. About a half hour later  another friend pulled up in his truck. He was going to spend the night with us. He brought his dog. We fixed something to eat and crawled into the tent. We told a few stories and then drifted off to sleep. About the middle of the night  the dog started to growl in the tent. It started to growl at first and we tried to calm him down. It was pitch black outside except for the stars in the sky. The dogs growl began to pickup. We tried to hold the dog down  then it started to growl and bark. We finally got the dog down on the tent floor when we could hear something outside the tent. Something then brushed the side of our tent. The dog immediately jumped up and started to bark. The dog barked for about 30 minutes and then it seemed to settle down. The area where we had pitched the tent was in tall grass. There wasn't much dirt or barren trails. The next morning we inspected for tracks to find out what it was. But the grass was so tall we found nothing. The noise that I heard that night  has made me a believer of what lurks in the woods.",Bigfoot
Report 3022: Nighttime encounter with campers near Duchesne  in Timber Canyon,This is located in Timber canyon.  GPS coordinateds are N40  1.680  W110  55.891.  It is about 14.6 miles from Highway 6 (Spanish Fork Canyon  Soldiers Summit) and 20.2 miles from Highway 40,UT,This is a sighting reported to my by Mike(last name withheld for privacy reasons)  a friend that lives in the same area as I do.  We went to the sight this past Saturday and Mike showed and told us..(a group of about 20 people) what occurred on the night of the sighting.   Mike went back to the sight the week before to make sure he could find it again since it had been 25 years since he had been into Timber Canyon.  He and his younger brother Lynn had gone fishing.  They had been in the area many times before with their father and other family memebers.  They arrived at their intended camp sight  about 7:30...they both had noticed once they entered the canyon that they saw no more wildlife....deer  birds  or anything.  Mike remembers having a erie feeling from the very moment they started down into Timber canyon.  He recalled hearing no noises  and commented to Lynn about this and the weird feelings he had of something or someone watching them.  They had forgotten worms so both went out into the willows and were digging worms...all the while feeling something was watching them.....Mike said the hair on the back of his neck was standing on end when ever he would look around to see if they could see anyone watching them.  They return to the truck  lit a lantern and put on the top of the truck...and proceeded to light a fire to roast a hotdog on.  His brother and he were sitting on a log and he noticed his brother had opened a beer and was not drinking it and was just staring at something and had ceased to talk to him....he looked in the direction his brother was looking and saw a sasquatch trying to sneek from off the road to a clump of willows and then to another and then proceed to peer at them by holding the willows off to one side and leaning over so he (the sasquatch) could get a good view of them.  Mike was so shocked he lost his balance and fell from the log and in getting back up noticed the sasquatch creeping behind the willows moving to the west and south.  Mike and his brother then lost visual sight of IT and could hear very loud thrashing noises of the sasquatch going through the creek and willows and up the canyon to the west and south of the camp site.  Mike said he did not smell any thing...and figured it was because of the smoke from the fire.   Mike estimated the whole sighting and noises lasted two minutes.  His younger brother wanted to stay there and sleep in the camper shell...but Mike was impressed very strongly to leave and get out of there.,Bigfoot

Report 30006: Hikers startled by encounter at remote cabin near Woodstock,Sugar knob patc cabin on great north mountain on the boarder of va and wva,VA,Two friends and I were backpacking on great north mountain in the winter of 2002. It was our second night and we reserved a stone cabin from the PATC  named sugar knob cabin  we had not seen anyone all day. There was an ice storm coming and we attributed it to that. We made a fire outside the cabin just before dusk while it was still nice out. We began to hear slow moving  very heavy footsteps walking around the perimeter of the location we were at. We thought it was a bear or a deer but it was clearly on two feet by the sounds it was making. We called out to see if it was a poacher or just someone walking around but no response was given. This is a pretty remote spot and definitely not very visited in the winter months. The walking sounds continued but because the sun was down by now we could not see too far into the woods. We all heard the walking sounds for quite a while and it really freaked us out so much so we abandoned the fire and pretty much locked ourselves into the cabin. All of us had a lot of outdoor experience and had backpacked a lot as well. We had never heard or experienced anything like this before. The sounds got closer once inside the cabin. It is a stone cabin so it is fairly well Insulated from noise. So whatever it was  was large. The footsteps seemed to stop and continue for maybe an hour or so. We made dinner inside and after we ate the footsteps were right next to the cabin  there was a window opposite the door with wood shutters on the blinds that were closed so I opened them expecting to see a person but we all witnessed a dark  very hairy large face looking at us about a foot outside the window. We were terrified  shaking and speechless. The creature took off after a few seconds of seeing us and vise versa. We never heard anymore sounds after that either. We stayed up all night  though just kind of standing guard. The next morning we awoke to ice everywhere and could not find any tracks or evidence of what we saw and heard. We hiked down the stony creek trail to the cars as fast as we could without getting hurt with the ice on the ground. There was a cabin journal at that time and we read it over that night after the incident and read several accounts that were similar to ours. We never stayed there again and this is the first time I have ever told this because I did not want people to think I was nuts or something.,Bigfoot

I'm 7 foot one but this thing was built  I'm tall but this must have been 6 inches to a foot taller than me. Though I was driving I was only going 15mph around a turn so I had time to see it. It was walking behind the guard rail and there is no way it was a man  it was way too dark out. Right after I saw it I pretty much had a panic attack. My pulse went up and started breathing fast and shaking. I never believed there was such thing as one but I am sure I saw one. I just can not believe how bad it scared me.,Bigfoot

Report 13285: Evening sighting by motorists on Tyson Road  off Route 100  outside Ludlow,It's off Rt 100 outside of Ludlow Vermont. It crosses some very heavily wooded  desolate areas.,VT,"My family and I went to Ludlow  Vermont for Columbus Day weekend since we enjoy the northeastern woods. We all enjoy observing the local flora and fauna in their natural settings and we often drive and/or walk the back roads looking for deer  moose  bear and whatever else we can spot. One evening we went ""Moose Spotting"" on Tyson Road since during a summer trip to the same area  earlier  we had observed eight moose in one evening. As we drove along Tyson Road I saw a large bipedal form cross the road in two strides. I asked one of my daughters  ""Did you see that? Tell me what did you see."" I purposely didn't say what I'd seen since I wanted to know if she'd seen what I'd seen. I wanted to be sure I had not imagined it. Very quickly she said  ""I don't know what it was but it was real big  maybe eight feet tall  hairy and crossed the road in two steps."" She saw the same thing I did.  It crossed the road about 50 feet ahead of us and judging from the trees where it crossed the road I'd say her height estimate is accurate +/- 20%. My other daughter didn't see it since she was in the back seat and was looking out the side windows of the car. I still don't quite believe it but I know what bear  deer and moose look like in natural settings since I've been hunting for 40 years. It wasn't anything I had ever seen in the woods. It walked across the road in two strides  was heavily built  covered in short dark hair and  as stated previously  approximately eight  feet tall. One more thing.  The day before  we had driven the same area  didn't see anything at all  no fauna at all  but we did hear some very odd vocalizations that sound very much like the recordings available on your website.",Bigfoot
Report 49902: Possible footprints found by a hiker on Mt. Ascutney,Park rangers are trying to keep this quiet  but have had reports of bigfoots and tracks. The tracks I saw were on the Futures Trail above the first parking lot and below the power line at Mt. Ascutney State Park in Windsor  VT.,VT,"I research mountain lions in NH  but I was caring for my mother and hadn't gotten out since Christmas Day  2014. On 5/24/15 I decided to just go for a walk  no research. I did a Meet-up with someone who walked much faster than me. She left me at the power line. I was way downhill  but was determined to at least make it to the power line. I did  but when I turned back to go down to the car  I saw two huge prints near a tree by the trail. When I got to them  the heels were 3-4 inches deep in the soil and leaves. They touched and the toes went out and away from each other like a duck's feet. They seemed to be 15 inches long  but it was hard to tell with all the leaves  unevenness  grass  etc. I took photos and measurements (even on a walk I take a camera and tape measure). It was interesting as hiding by that tree the Futures Trail went right past the tree  above was the power line and behind the tree was the park road  so that it was an advantageous hunting spot as animals coming from six different directions could easily be hunted down. Going back to the car  I saw two more tracks to the right of the trail. One was about 10 inches. The other seemed to be 15 inches  but with a 10 inch track inside it. The toes were 5 inches across for the three toes that were embedded in the bank. The other toes were over the hardened trail. There was also a 5x6 inch parallelogram shape. I kick myself now as I didn't take a photo. Later I saw a knuckle-walking gorilla on TV and thought  ""That's what that was!"" It was a knuckle print and also was very deep. At the bottom I asked the ranger to do a casting and he said I could instead  so I bought plaster of Paris. It wasn't enough. I had to go back several days later (rain). The casts are awful. There were too many leaves  the toes broke off  etc. The interesting part was that the park ranger acknowledged the report with a ""Yeah  we get lots of reports of bigfoots  but we try to keep it on the down low."" When I asked him about mountain lion sightings  he seemed scared and said  ""You think there are mountain lions up there?"" It was odd that bigfoot was ""normal"" and mountain lions were ""strange""! When I came back  I heard from someone else that this same ranger had been followed down the hill by something he nicknamed Roy. He was hoping it was a bigfoot and not a lion. Part of his job is to clear the trails and make sure everyone is off the mountain. That night it got dark  and he was also ""helped"" off the mountain  though ""it"" always stayed the same distance behind him.",Bigfoot
Report 13345: Possible stalking at Hildene Mansion grounds  near Manchester,You need to get on Vermont Route 7A and the turn-off for the park is labeled. I am not sure of exact directions before then but if you reach the Equinox Hotel you have gone too far.,VT,I am a Civil War re-enactor and I was participating in an event on the grounds of Hildene Mansion  which is Robert Todd Lincoln's home near Manchester  Vermont.  We were camped on the front lawn of the mansion  which is bordered on two sides by woods.  The whole area is somewhat off the beaten path  the house is probably a half mile from the main road. In the middle of Friday night  I would guess around 1-2 a.m.  I woke up and was walking to the building beside the main house to use the rest room  and as I left my tent and was walking toward the restroom I heard footsteps walking near me in the woods.  They seemed to follow me as I went to the rest room and as I walked back from the rest room they walked back with me to my tent. The whole time walking back I had an uneasy feeling like I was being watched. The next night  Saturday  I was sitting around the campfire around 11:00 pm talking and we heard footsteps coming from the woods which we were right next to  but the noises were coming from inside the woods.  We shined a flashlight on the area that the noise was coming from and it stopped immediatly and as we turned the flashlight off we heard the noises again heading away from us. Both times that I heard the noise it sounded like a large animal and from what I could hear it sounded like a large animal walking on two feet.  While there were other groups at the event I don't think that it was another person as there were trails that were clear that they could have used. Also of course it was so late at night and there was no light from a lantern or a flashlight.,Bigfoot

There is a large swampy area there. This area is very close to Green Mountain National Forest,VT,About 5:30 am on Rte 9 heading east in west Brattleboro VT my husband and I saw a small (I don't know what) running across the road. It was about 3 to 4 feet tall  long dark brown to black hair  running on 2 legs. I caught the animal in my headlights very clearly. The one thing we both said was that it was fast. Faster than any animal we have ever seen. It was crossing the road into the swampy area near the small whetstone brook. There were tall reeds there and it disappeared into them. We did not stop. in retrospect  I wish I had. It might have answered some questions we both had.,Bigfoot

Report 11313: Turkey hunters surprised by loud vocalizations near Wenatchee,about 3.3 Miles up the Ingersol Road.  N 47 15.824 W 120 13.426,WA,"While Turkey Hunting in the Ingersol (Colockum Wildlife Area in Central WA.)on 4-15-05 I came across some fecies with a diameter of about 2"". Which at the time I thought to myself it must be a Huge Bear. The following day 4-16-05 I walked about a mile down a fire guard road above where I had seen the fecies. The fog was coming in and I had not seen any Turkeys so I turned around and headed for the truck. The Fog was getting thick and I could only see about 35 yards.About halfway to the truck the wind changed and was blowing down the hill. I smelt this awful musty skunky smell and the hair on the back of my neck stood up. I quickly turned facing the smell with my shotgun slung but I did not see or hear anything.Again I could only see about 35 yards because of the Fog.At this moment I felt it was the smell of a Sasquatch. Then I got to thinking about the Fecies and told myself it must be a Bear. That evening I called my Nephew because he was going Hunting with me Sunday 4-17-05. I told him their must be a Large Bear in the area because I saw the fecies on Friday and on Saturday I had smelled him.Sunday mourning we arived at Daylight where I had seen 5 Turkeys the day before.We got all of our gear ready and hiked about 300 yards up the hill. I took out my Turkey Box Call and started Yelping with it.A Howl started below us about 150 yards a Coyote that turned into a Wolf that turned into a roaring blood curling sceam! I am 47 Years old and have Hunted the Cascade Mt.Range all of my life! I have NEVER heard anything like it in my entire life. My nephew turned and looked at me He's 16 and said what is that? I looked him strait in the eye and said it is a Sasquatch. The Length and the Volume and the Depth of the Howl could not be duplicated by a human being.I asked my Nephew if his gun was loaded and if he wanted to try to get a look at it? He said yes.We moved a little closer toward the scream but did not see anything. It was in scatered Pine Trees.We headed back up the ridge and West aways and stopped. Again I took out my Turkey Box Call and started yellping. Again about 400 yards up the canyon we heard a Deep Long Howl. The creature was making his way up the draw at a high rate of speed.I yelped on the Turkey Call again and he Howled again!!!He was moving away into thicker Timber this time he was 500 to 600 yards away and we never heard him again.",Bigfoot
Report 45418: Campers hear possible vocalization and have trailer shaken at Interstate State Park,South Campground of Interstate State Park,WI,We set out to do some squatching at Interstate State Park in Wisconsin.  Our party consisted of 4 adults and 2 children.  We set up camp and had dinner in the South Campground.  After dark we began our first night op at 10pm.  We left my wife and the 2 year old in camp with the fire.  Nick  his pregnant wife Jennie  their 5 year old son Atticus  and I went up a small ridge above our campsite to begin.  We walked slowly working south east of camp and further from the campground.  After about 5 minutes we heard something in the woods following us intermittently we stopped and waited with lights off for about 4 minutes. We continued to walk and stop with lights off until we got about a half mile from the camp.  At this point Atticus  the 5 year old  was ready to go back.  We started back and then stopped to do some whoops.  I did two whoops spaced about 30 seconds apart  no returned noises.  We continued to walk and stop.  When we were halfway back we let Atticus try some whoops.  He did two about 30 seconds apart.  After his second whoop there was an immediate response from within a hundred yards of us.  It was a slightly higher pitch whoop than I have heard before.  We waited about 4 minutes before continuing to go back to camp.  When we were about 100 yards from camp we stopped.  Jennie and Nick remained with lights off as Atticus and I turned our flashlights on and returned to camp.  As they sat by a tree they both heard something approaching them from the direction of the returned whoop.  It got so close that Nick stood up.  Then it took “four large  quick  heavy steps” back.  When Nick turned his flashlight on nothing was seen.  They then returned to camp.  As we sat and debriefed in camp we heard noises around camp  but dismissed them as raccoons.  I was looking to the woods beyond camp and began to see orange eye shine.  I thought it was a single star  but it moved lightly and would leave and return into view.  The next morning I saw that where I was seeing the glow was well below the ridge line and could not have been a star. Nick and I traded places while sitting in camp and he saw the same shine leave and return a few times as well.  Nick and I returned to near where he and Jennie had sat to leave an apple in a tree.  We all went to bed around 12:30 am.  Nick  Atticus  and I slept in a tent while Jennie  Sara and Hagen slept in a small teardrop camper.  After falling asleep Nick and I both woke up abruptly at 1:35am.  We immediately looked outside the tent to see a raccoon on the picnic table.  When we made noises to scare it away we heard something else moving around camp. We listened for a while before returning to sleep.  At 3:10 am we were woke up again.  We listened for a while  heard nothing  and went back to bed.  In the morning Jennie told us what happened to them in the camper.  At 1:35 am she was woke up not by the raccoon on the picnic table  but by something large walking in the woods behind camp.  She heard us scare away the raccoon and whatever was in the woods walked off.  At 3:10 am something started to shake the camper.  She said the camper was moved back and forth 3 times.  Her reaction was to laugh out loud from inside the camper.  She laughed because Sara and Hagen were sleeping through the event.  The shaking stopped and she heard something retreat back into the woods.,Bigfoot
Report 71733: Sighting  photos and video (distant) of a probable Sasquatch near Lac Du Flambeau Indian Rez,Powell Marsh  Manitowish Waters Wisconsin [Investigator (MM) note: Here are the GPS coordinates for the rough location of where he was standing when he shot the photos and video. The figure was an undetermined distance to the southeast of his position  running away generally towards the southwest. 46.0839196  -89.9131363,WI,Wanted to pass this by you as I was out duck hunting today (10/17/21) in north central Wisconsin… Powell Marsh area to be exact. This is a very remote marsh area surrounded by hundreds of thousands of acres of state and National forests.  You can access this marsh zone via paths the DNR has to maintain Water levels and people do watch migratory birds from a couple observation areas along road. I was more on a walk with the potential to jump shoot some puddle ducks as you can see not a cloud around.  Nor were there ducks. Not even sure it is a sighting but seemed rather strange. Something told me to look behind me as I was going the opposite direction as the figure. After watching this object for a couple hundred yards I decided to grab my cell phone. It is a long way away but appears black  large  and fast.  We have bear  very few moose  wolves  and occasional Elk around.  Feel free to say it is a guy on a bike-riding in the peat moss  or a guy on a 4 wheeler in a prohibited motorized vehicle area. It appears to be bipedal and walking deeper into the swamp in the muck. It is hunting season and I wouldn’t expect a person to be dressed in all black in a public hunting area.  I tried walking in it and turned back after about 5 feet. With naked eye I could see much better. The figure seemed to float as it moved across the swamp. Again a guy on a bike? After my hunt  I returned to the only 2 access areas to see if there were vehicles with bike racks or people out for a peat bog run. There was nobody around. I have been to the Marsh countless times and have never seen something like this. Although the distance a bit far for video. Figure seems quite large. Clearly appears to be in muck. I have photos and video but iPhone is a long way away and i am not an editing expert.  I am sure video can be manipulated and enhanced. ——————————— [Further comments provide when he sent in the photos: “ Here are pics. Was hunting ducks in Powell Marsh  Wisconsin.   Video I have problems getting to send but have it running thu the muck   Any thoughts are welcome. Watched with naked eye for about 300 yards before I figured I should try to get some photos/video. The small road behind is top of dikes running through the swamp.  about 10 feet wide with deep water on sides.  Clearly in the marsh not on road.  Of course left GoPro at cabin so stuck with iphone camera..  Would be happy to say it is nothing so I could hunt peacefully without thinking of this. Seems quite large. Was fast.

Report 8121: Hunting & fishing guide has afternoon encounter in deep woods near Lugerville,1 mile north of Lugerville grade road and 1/2 mile east of rock creek road  deep woods.,WI,This is totaly unbelievable  it has happened again. I can not even believe this myself  one sighting in a lifetime is hard enough but when this thing shows itself to me again  I'm starting to think maybe it is hanging around in the same type of woodland areas that I do. I am a Pro. woodsman and most of my outdoor treks take me away from all other human interferance  another words I go where other people do not want to go or will not attempt to go. The reason for this is that in my area the public are getting more and more populated in the areas that I choose to hunt or just get away  so I travel in deeper woods and swamplands away from there interferance. Well as I said I have seen this thing again  and this time it was about 3 miles from where I had spotted it the first time during hunting season. This sighting was as though it was curious or that it was following me  staying in the shadows moving only when I moved. Although this time at first it took me by complete suprise  I remained calm and also let myself observe this thing's every noticed action  trying not to let it have any knowledge that I was watching it as well. I would move taking a slow pace for about 50 yards at a time  turn to my side and kneel down acting like I was picking at the ground. It would stop and watch me from the shadows  as I move another 50 yards and watched it  it would wait till I would get about another 50 yards then it would stop and simulate what I was doing  it would crouch down and paw at the ground where I was kneeling. It would continue to sniff at the air and try to catch scent of me. After about a hour of this cat and mouse it dissapeared. I got a real uneasy feeling when I notice it about 75 yards to my right it was flanking me. This action made me very nervous  I have seen this with coyotes tracking a wounded deer. The thought ran in my mind that it was hunting me  but this feeling passed as I kept moving on. Again it would only move when I would move  perhaps it knew that its movments would be hidden by my coinciding movements  or it was trying to get in a direction of catching my scent. I kept moving in a southeast direction  stopping every 50 yards acting like I was digging and rutting around on the ground  keeping my head down and turning looking up with my eyes and not moving my head up. I thought it was gone but noticed it behind a uprooted tree root system peeking through a hole in the roots. It was closer now and was not aware that I new its location  at only about 30 yards I could make out its eyes and the right half of its face. The eyes seemed to be the color of a whitetail deer  no whites only dark. I moved on and after about another half an hour I was getting close to a area that loggers had clear cut  and it was gone. I sat in the area for at least another hour but it did not appear to me again. While I was watching this thing I got a chance to observe it and notice a lot of its features and charicteristics. Its height is only about 6 to 6 1/2 foot  it stays in the shadows  has dark brown hair with blackish streaks almost like what you could call brindle. Walks with a hunched over ape like character. I did not notice any smell. And it made no sound. I am convinced that this is a creature that with some time I can get close enough to again. No one can tell me that this freek of nature does not exist. It has showed itself to me twice.,Bigfoot
Report 1432:   Someone or something walks by house and peers from around a tree,Approximately seven miles from Cumberland out on HWY 48 is the general location. .,WI,"This incident happened a long time ago  and never told too many people about it.  I am a 31 year old Native American  and I was maybe 6 or 7.  I am glad to know that there are people like you who take this seriously.  It was night  and my sister and cousin were playing around on the phone (they would dial our number & hang up the phone so it would ring).  They had music playing (loud)  and were just playing around.  The door bell rang  and one of us answered the door  but there was no one at the door.  Well  this happened 2 more times.  We had a little housedog (we also had a st. bernard)  and my sister and cousin noticed that the house dog was crouched under a chair in our livingroom.  The last time the door bell rang  we all went outside  and couldn't see no one around (we all stood out on the porch). It was maybe a half hour later  my oldest brother went to the refrigerator.  The rest of us kids were playing in the hallway when he came running down the hallway with his hands to his face  and crying hysterically.  He ran in our parents room and jumped on the bed landing on his stomach.  He was crying pretty bad.  We all kept asking him what was wrong  and he finally told us what he saw.  He said he saw something peeking around the tree  and he said it was motioning to him to like ""come out"".  That's when he freaked out. After about 15 minutes (he calmed down some)  there was knocking at the back door  and the way they were knocking  it was like  open the door now!  When we opened the door  a guy who lived a few houses away  came in as white as a sheet  and was shaking pretty bad.  He said he broke down a ways from our place  and when he was walking up the road  he heard something walking in the woods with him.  He didn't know what it was.  He said he was really glad to see our lights on.  Our parents weren't home (mother working; father-didn't know where he was)  but we ended up calling our Uncle's  who lived next door to us.  They arrived a few minutes after we called them  and they had their shot guns with them.  They came and talked with the guy that came to our house.  I think one of my uncles took him home.  There was 6 of kids home (one was our cousin).  My uncles went outside to look around  my oldest sister and our cousin wanted to go outside too.  Well  when they opened the back door  our st. bernard  well let me tell you  for the size of those dogs  that dog would not let those girls out  and he even growled at them.  Well my sister and cousin backed up from the door  and as they did that  the st. bernard came running into the house.  Well  my sister and cousin still went outside  and as they were standing by this little trail by the house  they noticed some dark form at the bottom of the hill/trail.  They thought maybe it was a stump  but then the stump moved and turned to look at them.  My cousin said it had red (?) eyes.  They came back inside right away.  Our cousin went out again (back door)  and went around the house to the front  and when she got to the corner of our house  she looked up towards my uncles garage  and said she saw something peeking around the garage.  She said she thought it was one of our other cousins  but she noticed this had a cone shaped head as it looked around the garage towards our house.  They ended up putting us kids to bed (3 of us).  My sister and I were pretty scared  and our little brother (he had a crib) didn't really know what was going on.  My sister and I were shaking in bed.  Our brothers crib was right next to the window.  We were really hoping whatever was out there  didn't come to our window.  Well  we did see a big figure go by.  We were just so scared!  It seemed like forever when our parents got home. When they did we told them what happened.  My mother ended up calling a spiritual guide  and he told her that there was probably 3 of those things around the house that night.  He also told her that they were looking for a boy to take.  He said that one of them may have lost one of their own  and came looking for a young boy to replace the one they lost.",Bigfoot
Report 41734: Bow hunter recalls being shaken by possible incidents near Mount Horeb,Between Springdale Center Road and Town Hall Road.,WI,This happened almost 24 years ago  but it has never left me in all these years.  And I have never told anyone about these two incidents.  The first incident happened when I was bow deer hunting during the early season  as I remember that the leaves on the trees were still green.  I had returned to my car that was parked in a nearby field and got my hunting gear put away.  I then sat in my car waiting for about 10 minutes for my hunting friend to return so that we could go home. When he didn't return (he did return after the incident) I got out of my car and walked down close to the edge of the woods  maybe about 10 feet or so from the edge of the woods  shortly thereafter I heard something coming from my left just inside the woods edge.  It was making a lot of noise as it was walking through.  I thought this was my friend coming back  but then I thought that this  was “very odd” for my friend since he was really quiet in the woods.  As the “walker” was about right in front of me I called out my hunting friend's name to which I received a rather loud “guttural growl”.   But what ever the “walker” was it did not break stride  it just kept right on walking rather loudly away from me going parallel with the edge of the field just inside the woods edge.  I have listened to over and over again the bipedal walking audio on the BFRO website - http://www.bfro.net/avevid/sierrasounds/911.asp#bipedal . It sounded just like this  but add in some very loud branch breaking and you will be very close to what I heard that night!!!!! I'm 6' 2” tall  and when the “walker” did its loud “guttural growl” when it was right in front of me it sounded like it was at about the height that my head was at.  I would estimate that the place in the field  that I was standing at was about two feet higher than in the woods where the “walker” was at. The second incident that took place happened in the same location  but about 200 yards from where the first incident happened about a week  or so earlier.  Both times I had been hunting from the ground. The hunting friend that was with me from the earlier time was also there along with my sister's boyfriend.  We split up with about 3 hours of hunting time left.  It was really quiet for about the first hour  but then things started to change.  I heard all sorts of noises that I can't explain nor identify that happened in front of me from about my 10 o'clock position to about my 2 o'clock position.  I did see what appeared to be something walking into the thicker part of the woods.  This looked like the arms and legs of something going from the more open part of the woods  to the more thicker part and was about 40 yards away from my location. After seeing the arms and legs of whatever the things were  the tops of the smaller trees started swaying violently back and forth.  This went on and off for about a ½ hour to 45 minutes.  What really scared me was when the rocks started to be thrown in my direction.  The size started out as about golf ball size  and by the time that I “turned tail” the size was about softball size. I would describe the color of what I saw of the arms and legs to be about a rather dark red to almost black.,Bigfoot
Report 7241: ATV'ers find footprints near Pt.Pleasant,Off of Rt 2 on Greer Rd.,WV,"We were riding our 4-wheelers in Mason Co WV  We were off of Greer Road on a friends property and stopped to get something to eat. This area we were at is not populated at all. I went over and sat on a log to eat and my husband asked me what kind of track was by my foot  When I looked down I was astounded! My husband wears a size 13 boot  And this was in cold weather so the thick boots make his foot look even bigger and this footprint made his look small! it was atleast 16 to 18 in long and 6 to 8 in at the widest point.There were about 3 or 4 more footprints leading down to the creek. I walked up and down the banks looking for more but I couldn't find anymore. I am 5'9"" and have fairly long legs and I could not put my foot beside one of the prints and reach the other one. This was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen! Regretably none of us had a camra  but there were aprox 15 of us who seen these. Everybodys first reaction was that it was a hoax  but in my opinion if someone was going to fake this they would have done it in a more populated area. Our friend Jack   whos property we were on called the Department of Natural Resourses to ask them about this  they sent one truck down to look at the print. This truck left and came back with about 5 more trucks. They told Jack not to come back there while they were there. After they were done one of them stopped and told Jack that it was only a black bear print  I am no zoologist but I have seen black bear prints  and this was not one. There were no claw marks  but there were toes. And if that was a bear  and it left tracks that big  I wouldn't want to meet it! This happned in winter of 2001  I have not told very many people because the ones I have look at me like I need to be locked up! I am very glad to find this site  and to share my amazing experince with people who understand!",Bigfoot
Report 28382: Possible activity outside a residence near Lavalette,3 mi. from Lavalette  WV an unincorporated area.,WV,"To start off I've been interested in cryptozoology since i was about twelve years old. I was about fourteen yrs. old and living on Mt. union rd. at the time. It was about 9:00pm on a fall night. My cousin and I were sitting on the hill next to our storage building smoking a cigarette and looking down into the holler next to the road. All of a sudden we heard something move down over the hill so I whispered ""shush  if we’re quiet we may see a deer."" We continued to sit there  about 2 min  until a car came down the hill and its lights flashed on something tall standing near the bottom. It turns to its side quickly then looks up the hill towards us. After the car had passed it was dark again and he heard something huff and puff and then it sounded like it took off up the hill running towards us so we ran to the house about 30 yards away. We ran inside the house and never heard anything the rest of the night.",Bigfoot
Report 34043: Observation by a hunter through his scope by the New River Gorge Bridge near Fayetteville,New River Gorge,WV,To keep it short..I was deer hunting in the new river gorge in Fayetteville WW and it was in 2007  the week of thanksgiving. It was evening with about two hours of daylight left and I noticed movement about 60 yards towards the gorge from my position..I raised my gun to view the movement through the scope..after holding it in position for 10 sec or so I saw a very large hand appear from the side of a large Poplar tree..it was palm against the tree and I saw fingers mostly..then to my surprise I saw a head peek from around the large tree and two LARGE eyes affixed on a head if a creature I've never seen before..and I'm a hunter..have been since I was 8..I'm now 38.. The Bigfoot blinked twice while looking at me and then stepped back behind the tree..I viewed it for about 20 seconds while it was looking at me..my mind just couldn't figure out what it was and I knew what it wasn't..I had no desire to shoot it and very well could have but my mind and body almost seemed to be in a state of shock while viewing it..I had to cross near the location on the trail out if the woods and I was F'n terrified even with a loaded deer rifle..my hair stood on end when I realized that I would have to go towards the location to get out of the woods..I called my uncle as soon as I got to my jeep and told him..he believed me..I am a VERY honest man and would never lie about this..the thing is though..I never heard it run away or move through the leaves..and you can hear movement from 200+ yards off in these woods..it's like it just disappeared..I came home very shaken from the experience and it changed my life..now I know that it is out there. It was very cool looking..about 7ft tall  it had very dark large pupils and around the pupils its eyes were almost owl like..it had brownish blond fur and it had a visible face..it almost looked like the troll faces that you used to put on your pencils as kids..really..but  it was very clean looking and not what you would expect..its fingers were long and thick with no fur and it had dark fingernails..I had my scope on 9 power and it was equivalent to being about 30 ft from me visually..it was real and I would take a polygraph and swear on my life.,Bigfoot

I was walking the property next to mine as logging interested me in how it worked and how the land looked afterward. I'd go onto the place after the workers left for the day at 3PM. It was rather hot and plain nasty so I usually headed out after 4 -5 PM. This day they were at the far end of the valley (or ""holler"" as the locals call it-I'm from CA originally). I was armed as there are wild dogs  bears  and a black panther running round back here.  Walking to the far end there are two smaller branches off to your right  the first is shallow and only extends a few yards. Every time I walked to base of the hill before  I felt like I just didn't want to venture into the woods. I had found another way onto the ridge above on the right a few months before-but I also got pretty badly spooked and kind of stayed away. I had trails and just went wherever-until the loggers hit this patch. The past few weeks before this I had roamed all over the logging trails and as soon as they got back there I began to feel very uneasy. Walking alone  I decided to keep looking around staying extra cautious. This day I went left and followed a trail that took me to the ridge top which is dead center of the valley. I also had a very ""something is watching me"" feeling so I wasn't what you would call happy  just taking note of where things were and enjoying the view. The trail followed along this ridge and would take me near where I had all the strange feelings. I stopped as the feeling of being watched was getting a bit too much when I heard a tree fall  just on the other side of the ridge not more than about maybe seventy yards away. I was wondered just why in the hell would a tree fall but something told me not to investigate and to get off that hill. I decided to turn around to call it a day. I walked maybe ten yards when something loped between two trees on the ridge to my right. My first thought was some loggers or forestry guys were still on the property. It looked to be wearing Carhart brown clothes. I went maybe twenty more yards and then it hit me: I had been on that ridge a few days before  I knew where those trees were and if  IF it was a man he had to be around seven to eight feet tall. A day or two later I went back to the ridge where I saw the thing and took a good look. I never felt any real strangeness on this side and didn't then  but I did confirm that whatever I saw was very big. I also could swear I saw the right arm and leg but not the head  thinking back it was kind of leaning forward as it walked along so the head was behind the tree when I noticed it.",Bigfoot
Report 26963: Blacksmith recalls seeing a creature come down a mountainside and shares a sketch he drew,,WV,"This is the story as was relayed to the investigator. ""Just after dark the witness  which was 15 at the time  and his friend were getting nightcrawlers to go fishing with. Just behind their house  which like many West Virginia houses is rural  their was an old logging road which was covered by very heavy green briars. The witness heard something coming down the mountain through the green briars. He shined his flashlight and saw an enormous animal which was built like a large bodybuilder. He watched the animal from 60 feet away traveling right to left. He watched the animal for several seconds. What stuck out his memory the most was the swinging arms and the hair 10-12 inches long hanging down off of the forearms. The hair in general was mostly straight and dark brown in color with reddish tinge on tips. It really scared his friend and him. The next day based on a sapling they estimated the animal to be 9 feet tall.""",Bigfoot
Report 6037: Hunter hears unusual vocalizations on two occassions,Bridger Teton National Forest- HWY 30 out of Cokeville  WY  North to HWY 89 to Salt Creek pass  right turn onto Forest Service Rd 10072 east into National forest about 16mi from main highway to FS 10138 to 10128 north to Thompsom Pass Please don't post actual directions online.,WY,"There were two separate incidents within 12hr time of sounds so unusual that  to this day  I can't explain or rationalize out of my mind.  I had arrived at a campsite near Thompson Pass  the evening before the start of deer hunting season. The campsite was about 500yds off the forest service road and in a dense pine forest  near a logging trail that led to a creek. I settled in for the night in a sleeping bag in the cab of my truck  waking up at about 0400  with the need to go to the bathroom. I rolled the window down and listened for any ""critters""  most notably bears. Grabbing a flashlight  I left the truck and relieved myself. As I was preparing to return to the truck  I began hearing the sounds of something breathing deeply to my left and to the rear. Shining my flashlight in that direction  I saw nothing  heard nothing move. I quickly got back in the truck  and then began hearing this warbling  like a man yodeling in a high pitch  from the direction of Thompson Mountain. I rolled up the window and stayed awake with my .44mag. I waited until dawn to leave the truck to hunt- I usually leave about a half hour before dawn  depending on how far I'll be walking to the area I plan to hunt  but those noises had really spooked me. I got to the heavily wooded ridge partially up Thompsom Mt  at  the convergance of two main game trails  remaining there until about 3pm  only seeing one small doe moving quickly head hunched down. I passed on it. I then began moving down back in the general direction of my truck  and keeping an eye on the area where a spring comes out of the side of the mountain  and trickles down to Witherspoon creek. From the area where I had been hunting came this bone vibrating sound  so loud with like multiple harmonics   its hard to explain. It was beyond a roar. I half expected to see a dinosaur crash through the trees  it was such an unreal sound. It lasted 4-5 seconds. I was out of there and on the way home  scared spitless. I've since mentioned the experience to a few co-workers  and none have had or heard of anything like it.",Bigfoot
Report 1241: Two gov't geologists witness hominoid creature cross road about 30 min. east of Yellowstone Park's East Gate,We were on a widing reach of highway with dense frest cover on either side. At the precise location of the siting we identified a standard under-road box culvert with a secondary channel flowing through. There were standard metal barrier s on either side of the road protecting the culvert and vehicles. We had seen no homes or lights for perhaps 30 minutes and it was another 30 minutes before we reached the park gates - where there were no rangers available to report the siting to.,WY,The siting was witnessed by my friend and myself  both Geologists  while driving into Yellowstone from Cody for employment at the Park for the summer. My friend was taking his turn at driving and I was soaking up as much as I could see as well as providing a running commentary to keep my friend alert during our long drive. As we came around a curve in the road our high beams illuminated a large dark shaggy figure coming up out of the ditch on the left side (south)of the road at a distance of about 200 -250 ft. As we approached the figure at a speed of about 45 miles per hour  it looked first at the vehicle (we noticed the yellow reflection from it's eyes that is seen in a dog's eye when light catches it at night) then deliberately turned it's head away from the lights. That motion was non-human or bearlike  in that the the shoulders  chest and head moved simultaneously as it caught site of our vehicle and then turned it's face away from the headlights. We slowed (OK   we slammed on the brakes)  stunned at what we were seeing and trying to rationalize we were looking at. A hominid creature  perhaps 7 to 7.5 ft in height (we have a 7 foot friend as a reference)  massing perhaps 600 to 800 pounds without obvious signs of obesity  standing completely and comfortably upright  came up out of the ditch from the left side of the road right at the edge of the metal barrier above the culvert. It took 3 extrodinarily long and fluid strides across the highway (22 ft) and another 3 of 4 shorter strides down the other side of the road actually appearing to catch hold of the metal barrier/railing with one long fingered hairy hand and swinging down under the road into the box culvert or channel bottom completely out of our line of site. We stopped the vehicle within 25 feet of the culvert and watched the final decent of the creature into the darkness of the channel. At this point we speed on toward the east gate of YNP hoping to find a ranger to report the siting to and perhaps to go back and take another look. There was no one at the gate due to the late hour and we didn't see any lights on anywhere  so we continued on to our destination and went to bed deciding not to contaminate each others observations with discussions until morning. In the morning we both independently described graphically and in writing as much of what we had seen 6 hours earlier. This is a synopsis of our findings. There were virtually identical down to the movment of which leg moved first as the creature crossed the road. The head appeared to merge into the neck and there was no snout or protrusion from the face as would be commonly seen in a bear (I've seen hundreds  up close and in person) The face was not clearly visible and was only glimpsed for a moment. We both got an impression of long hair covering some of it. The nostrils were large and open  but neither of us were able to describe mouth or teeth. The eyes weren't exceptional  just the reflection of gold  like a dog's. What each of us can still describe with great clarity in the size  shape and unique fluid movment of the creature. It was big  7-7.5 ft ish  but not much bigger than that. It was heavy and powerful looking. In shape  it possessed a rather blocky  yet elongated head slightly domed on top of the cranium  thick short neck  broad shoulders  full chest. It was square and longer through the torso and hips than a human. As it walked across the road in front of us  the buttocks were clearly seen as muscular masses moving under heavy shaggy hair  they obviously attached to long powerful  muscular thighs longer in proportion to a human  big knees that functioned as a human knee  thick mulcular calves and feet in proportion to the rest of the oversized body. The soles of the feet appeared to be hairless or less covered in hair and very dark in color. The arms hung from heavily muscled shoulders and were longer than a human reaching to knee length and extending fully and almost a horizontal positon to the front and rear of the body as it moved. The elbows were perhaps a little further down the arm that on a human - or the unusual length of the arm made it appear so. The hands were large and long fingered  neither of us could later describe the palms  nails  or other than the backs of the hands which were covered in the same long shaggy dark brown hair as the rest of the creature. The creature made no sound nor gesture throughout the siting. It appeared a little startled at our vehicle appearing out of the night  but in no other way frightened or threatening. Starled the heck out of the two of us  though!,Bigfoot
Report 12302: Yellowstone backcountry ranger describes sighting  other incidents,The sighting occurred in a high-elevation park meadow in the Fan Creek Drainage in Yellowstone's northwest corner.,WY,"The following account was given to Colorado curator T.E. Stein during a phone interview with Bob Jackson in 2003. Recently  Jackson gave permission to submit his account to the BFRO.  Jackson  also known as ""Action Jackson "" was legendary among park supporters - notorious among outfitters and scofflaws - for his enforcement of park rules and regulations. He retired as a Yellowstone ranger in 2004. Few people have ever known Yellowstone's backcountry and its wildlife like Jackson. ""The  first time heard anything was in the mid-late 70s. An outfitter and I were riding up Fan Creek in the northwest section of the park. Up the drainage in Stellaria Creek  we heard a sound that just kept going and going. It was probably a mile away. It filled the whole valley up - kind of 1 000 like elk going to their death. I couldn’t believe this thing had that much volume for that long  a period of time. He had never heard anything like it  neither. ""A couple of weeks later  I was coming out from Sportsman Creek  taking a trail which comes out of Fan Creek. I was 11 miles back in  up high in a subalpine fir meadow complex. I was on a  steep sidehill with horses and in woods but down below about 40-50 yards there was a kind of fairly flat meadow  with dense  subalpine thickets. There were these low fir growths that have a centerpiece tree and then everything kind of cone-shapes to ground. They were about 20 yards wide or so. ""The horses were flaring their noses and snorting  like they do when a grizzly bear is real close  but I could see fairly good all around and I couldn’t see one. So I started looking down below me  and the horses were really agitated – they’re wanting to get out of there. I held them but only with effort. ""I looked down to see where griz was  and I saw a deer at edge of thicket. All at once it bolted and started jarring ahead perpendicular to me. Right then coming out the other side was this thing that was running on two feet. It was black like a bear and it had long arms and ran. I think I held it there 30 seconds  but it got scared and then came out. It ran but not super fast. It ran to another thicket and went at angle out of thicket to another thicket about 40-50 yards away (At this point  the creature was 75 yards downslope.) ""It kept hitting these thickets trying to get away from me. I’ve never seen a bear do that. They’ll always take a straight line. ""The first thing I thought was “bear” but right away I realized this black shaggy thing wasn’t a bear. This thing was smart. I’ve never seen animal trying to pick up protection as it fled. ""I tied that together with sound had on other side of the drainage. ""It wasn’t that tall – it looked like it was like 6 foot  maybe 6' 5"". The side of the face looked like it had a lot of fur. Most of the time it was angling away  so I only got a good look at the head for probably the first 10 steps. ""The proportions of the torso - it looked more stocky than anything else. I notived the arms swung more than a human’s would and it didn’t have elbows cocked. ""This was no hoax. I’ve ridden maybe 50 000 to 70 000 miles in the backcountry on horses and you encounter a lot of bears when you do that. This thing  whatever it was  the horses looked straight down to it.",Bigfoot
Report 2216: Driver sees bipedal creature in headlights near Yellowstone hot spot,Maybe 20-30 minutes east of the Park,WY,"Leaving the east gate of Yellowstone near sundown. Somewhere between there and Cody...maybe halfway...and after dark. I saw a dark  bipedal motion moving out of the tunnel of light provided by my van. It was very brief. When I got back to Florida at some point I received a field & stream and read about the skookum cast. After reading it I went to your site and found the "" Wyoming Hotspot"" and it all came back. I'm a cautious observer and realize how your eyes can play tricks. I asked my wife...prior to telling her about the skookum cast article or the information on your site... about whether she remembered me saying anything on the way to Cody when we left Yellowstone during our trip there. She said all she remembered was me joking about seeing Bigfoot. I wanted to be sure it wasn't a ""manufactured memory"" because sometime had passed. It was a long day...we had seen lots of wildlife and finished with a nursing grizzly with 2 cubs just before leaving the park. What I saw reminded me of a moose in color. I've always described moose as being difficult to see at night by saying it's the black that moves at the outer limits of your lights. Often you don't get a clear outline of the animal but know by the way it moves. I don't know if that makes sense but it's 2:30 am now so I'm a bit groggy. I was planning a trip back this summer to take a better look around. I was finishing a Masters last summer at Colorado State and had a week between classes so we headed to Yellowstone in the hopes of seeing Grizzly....and the Park. Had I been in Washington I probably would have been looking for Gigantipithicus. Many years ago I talked to Dr. Krantz and Peter Byrne while working on a project for an Animal Behavior class at the University of Florida. When I called them they seemed credible and were helpful. My memory is from a second or 2. Two strides that took it from the middle of the eastbound lane  to the middle of the westbound lane  to the gravel on the side of the road...dark...large. Half laughing I told my wife I saw a sasquatch...she said so did she...we both laughed and said we must be tired...she said turn around  which made me laugh even more...We're just tired. She pointed out we didn't know when we'd ever get back. I didn't think anymore about it till I went to your site. I'll be going back this summer...probably June...depending on the cost of gas...it's getting crazy again.",Bigfoot
Report 13033: Local hunter hears multiple screams after dark outside Sundance,From Sundance Wyoming east on I-90 take Moskie Road county 207 to Grand Canyon Road  north to Williams Gulch Road.,WY,It was the second day of deer season and I was going to try my luck in the Black Hills. It's the last chance hunt in this part of Wyoming for deer. There was a good snow a few days before. I had an old 64 Ford van and I put a shanty heater in it though the roof vent. I drove down Grand Canyon Road to Williams Gulch. I had to shovel out an area to park the van. I didn't go up the Williams road because the van was only two wheel drive and didn't want to get stuck in the snow. I parked where Grand Canyon and Williams Gulch road met. I got fire wood that day and hunted up the ridges. I had my dog with me and got ready to spend the night. I ate something and sat in the van enjoying the wood heat. The wood stove was doing its job all to well and had to open a side window on the van. Soon after I heard a strange screaming noise outside. I still had my boots on so I went out the back doors of the van to hear it again. I grew up in upper Michigan and been in the woods all my life camping hunting etc. This was something I never heard before. It sounded like a WHOAAAAAAAAAAAA that lasted for about 20 seconds. If you hear something that long it sounds like it last forever. It seemed to be some ways away and when it stopped you could hear echo off the ridges. What had me frightened was the volume of it. Whatever made it had on hell of a lung capacity. Afterwards my dog would not come out of the van. It screamed about four or five times. that night I just laid there on the cot wondering what the hell it was. The next day I didn't see one deer and that in its self is strange for the Black Hills. I don't know what I heard and I'm the type of person that only believes what I see bigfoot ufo etc. There is nothing in North America that I know of that makes a sound like that. To me it's an unexplained scream but it's been bugging me for years.,Bigfoot
